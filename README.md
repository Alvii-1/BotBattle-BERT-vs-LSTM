# BotBattle-BERT-vs-LSTM
Comparing the accuracy of BERT vs LSTM models on how well they are able to classify sentiments of social media comments

Under heavy construction!

Initially had decent results showing an the expected outcome of BERT with higher scores overall, due to its longer context capacity over LSTM. However something broke... Working on improving the comparison and potentially expanding it to include a lightweight GPT model (RIP my laptop) and maybe others. 

The project is currently in .ipynb format as it originally was when first created. I don't intend on changing this unless it presents problems when more models are added.

The datasets are attached, social media comments arise from Spotify comments (didn't even know those were a thing?) and general sources comments from a wide variety of platforms. I wonder if this has any effect on performance, but I wouldn't generally expect comments from Spotify to be very different in terms of relative sentiment makeup compared to anywhere else. Possible future directions.

Also, when I return to this, I will definitely fix up the performance visualization. I know I can make those damn charts prettier.
