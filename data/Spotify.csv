i love the selection and the lyrics are provided with the song you're listening to!,positive
"still extremely slow when changing storage to external sd card.. i'm convinced this is done on purpose, spotify knows of this issue and has done nothing to solve it! over time i have changed sd cards, each being faster in read, write speeds(all samsung brand). and please add ""don't like song"" so it will never appear again in my searches or playlists.",negative
"it's a great app and the best mp3 music app i have ever used but there is one problem that, why can't we play some songs or find some songs? despite this the app is wonderful i recommend it. it's just the best.",positive
"i'm deleting this app, for the following reasons: this app now has a failing business model. whether streaming services like it, or not: the consumer doesn't want to pay for music they can't fully own, and 6 ads successively, upon logging in, before a single song, is too much. closed the app during ad number 6, and i'm more patient than most. if those are the only ways you can profit: you've already peaked. all that's left is your decline.",negative
can't play spotify when on wifi,negative
"i had amazon premium music family package and it was good. everyone could listen to whatever they liked on their respective alexas in their rooms by just asking to play, no problem. we now have spotify premium family and the alexa integration is poor. it just doesn't like spotify. it just stops playing all of the time , you can't play on different alexa devices at the same time just by asking. why isn't the integration better?",negative
worst app always says i'm offline and never showed any song or podcast,negative

"usually i love the app, but i'm having the same problems everyone else is reporting. random pauses, stops playing and doesn't restart, and currently i can't view the song or podcast i'm currently playing so i can't pause or skip back and forth. it's fairly unusable at this stage which isn't acceptable for a paid service.",negative

the best music app ever i have seen,positive
"wow!! ....all of a sudden my login doesn't work. even though i'm 100% positive it is correct. this morning my app asks me to login? why? this hasn't happened before, so obviously you are having some problems. just found an email in my account telling me to change my password because of 'suspicious behaviour'.... yeah because logging into spotify on my xbox is suspicious!? thanks for the stress this morning, didn't need that. i won't be renewing....my way of teaching you a lesson.",negative

wide range of songs collection,positive
"what's the deal here? compared to the desktop version, this is inferior to it! why is the ability to play any songs so bare or if not, barely free? is there more that need to be said about this? i think i made my point clear enough!",negative
spotify is awesome! i love having any obscure artist i can think of at my fingertips as well as easy access to newer things! update: lost a star for constantly asking for a review i've already done.,positive

podcasts becoming a nightmare. trying to get rid of podcasts on this app is ridiculous. stupid things are all over the home page. you can click not interested till you're blue in the face and i'll just keep throwing up more spam casts.,negative
best birthday present i have ever received from my baby brother! i listen to something at least everyday. so happy of the selection of christian artists and music. love finding new artists. let just listening to great podcasts. thank you so much for such a wonderful app!,positive
the only downside is they rotate songs in and out so one month you can listen to that great song next month maybe not.,negative
the sound quality is really good and i can listen to my favourite songs anytime and anywhere without any disturbance. that's really good experience ðÿ‘ i loved this app alot. keep providing us the best service ðÿ‘ðÿ‘,positive
keeps cutting out and not showing what song is playing,negative
as a paying customer there is nothing i can say about spotify. it is perfecto.,positive
so much adds like i get 6 adds before i start a song and you need premium just play a song itself.,negative
"exceptional application for online songs. i loved the option of merging the app with inter music player of samsung. overall, application works flows less.",negative
spotify is better than joox fosho,positive
"since disney started to pay for ads for disney+, the non-premium version of spotify became useless because after 1 or 2 songs you get at least 2 ads, one or two from disney+ and sometimes one more. i will change my review if i won't get so many ads.",negative

"it was good at first, but it wouldnt let me pick a song and it had forced me to listen to an entire playlist to get to my fav song because they limited it to 6 skips per hour, why are you limiting skiping songs?",negative
"i love it soo much and i will rate it a 4 star, the problem is that there are constant ads, and the singing option near the lyrics doesn't seem to appear for me anymore",negative
"would rate it 5. but whenever, i play something on my playlist it changes to a different song and not my playlist . i hope this get fixed soon.",negative

please turn off shuffle play!!!,negative
"its good but when u want to play a song , they give other songs yo listen to instaed of the song and sometimes when u trying to get to the song the skips are limited .it has the same effect on the playlist u cant enjoy ur song without other songs interfering and eepecially adding songs u dont like to ur playlist",positive
in the middle of songs its pauses and then restarts the whole song. you have to go into the app and play the song again.,negative

"what the hell? i'm having the same issue as ""the patoto man"", minus random songs being added. i can't even choose any song at all that i want to play. i can't view them properly, i can't play them directly and it only starts a 10 second snippet of the song. i can't even listen to any music i want, and can't even have playlists play the music i want. and the big one, it all seems to just be a samsung/ google play store issue. i can play just fine on apple mobile devices like ipads.",negative
this app is good but fixe it i can't sign in,negative

i love spotify just wish i can download music,positive
it's awesome and great music app,positive
works super well.... when it works... the app doesnt seem to want to load 3/4ths of the time. ultra laggy. locks up my phone occationally... makes no sense. otherwise. features are plentiful and you can find most anything.,negative
i can't even listen to my favorite songs bc of the shuffle and i tried different accounts and it doesn't even change even a little,negative

"i love listening to music (i use it as a coping mechanism), so i love spotify so much too. but, about 3 days ago (?), my spotify wouldn't load, it would just stay on the spotify logo screen thing. tried installing it and uninstalling it for 5 times, restarted my phone 2 times, cleared the cache/data for about 8 times, and i still can't open it (also waited for an hour for it to load).",negative
"used to be good. it dont let me play my playlists, pause, stop, start and go back a track from my phone (samsung). i emailed spotify and asked help from a member but nothings working.",negative
"for an app that has been available for 8 years, the amount of issues i have is frustrating. like some other say, it stops playing randomly while in the background, even though i allow background data use and all that. at times while running in the background, the app dissappears from my toolbar and i have to open it independently, then i have no way to click on what is playing at the bottom so i must force close it.",negative
i really enjoy my music life nice app thanks for spotify,positive
i cant open the app. it's been 2 days please fix this.,negative
it's not that bad but why can't i just directly play the song i pressed on?,negative
love spotify great for all the family,positive
"this app worked well until v8.6.98.900, when trying to install newer versions of the app, my pioneer car system wouldn't work with spotify anymore. this means that i have to upgrade all my apps manually to be able to keep the last working version of their app. hope spotify will fix their broken app soon.",negative
"i use to love this app, but i soon hated it because it keeps on playing music and other songs that isn't on my playlists or my liked songs, i've turned off the option for it to do that ( play similar songs when your playlists ends. something like that ) but it doesn't work, i don't recommend.",negative
excellent music experience,positive
this is an amazing app i use it all the time and it's very affordable. if you are looking for a app to lift your mood spotify it the one you go for.,positive
spotify has literally accounted for everything when it comes to your best music experience. it's so easy to use but there's still so many features and i honestly didn't realize how much i needed it until i got it. would recommend above apple music as it's more aesthetically pleasing and has way better features. get spotify!!! (i do have premium) but even with ads it's still good.,positive
sometimes it is not working,negative
very annoying and disturbing,negative
good audio play experience with spotify.,positive
the best music app till now ...,positive
i hate ads and they do send work 1 month free premium (super upp),negative
i have gotten 10 ads in a row trying to listen to a single song. the ads were longer then the sond,negative
"i have used this app for the last 2 years straight, always use premium, it's an essential",positive
"app stuck on loading black screen with spotify logo, restarted, reinstalled, no luck! using note 20 ultra",negative
"2022.07.08 would like to be able to save queue as playlist. would like to be able to scroll back in queue an arbitrary number of titles. when playlist is playing, be able to add songs to queue, rearrange playlist sequence, and ""save changes to playlist?"" prompt at end of playlist... ðÿ¤·â€â™‚ï¸",negative
"worst app for music,so many ads.",negative
best song app all over,positive
"i love ðÿ’“ this app . it has ads but not that level, that's the reason. and you can choose your favorite artist. you can enjoy different playlist in just 28 mb. and resso use 68 mb. so i prefer spotify.",negative
nice music quality,positive
umm... lately there is auto pausing problem when the screen locks hope it will fix soon,negative
amazing songs and artists!!! great app 10/10 review!!,positive
"not bad but not good. i wanted to listen to a song that i like but suddenly it played a different song. i tried adding my fav songs to my playlist but it played a song that i did not add on my playlist. well, that's okay.",negative
"i absolutely love spotify and i'm obsessed with music, but i only rated it 4 starts for a reasom. ok so basically my spotify was doing this weird thing it like had only one song in all my playlist and literally nothing would play, and i had no idea how to fix. and whats weird is that it would work on my other devices with my spotify account just not on my phone. so it might be my phone but idk. and another thing it does is it just randomly kicks me out of the app sometimes. well thats all i have",negative
i really love it my favorite thing about this app is the lyrics ðÿ˜ it's amazing i love singing along with my favorite songs ðÿžµ ðÿ’•,positive
best music app....best collections.....they wil create playlists specially for youu...i loved it best app ever,positive
nice app but the ads is very disturbing,negative
stopped working this morning for some reason.,negative
how long will it take to fix the payment option. being on the free plan is not a nice experience. i want to get back on premium but its failed now for the 2nd month.,negative
this is nice app i love spotify,positive
having streaming trouble with new update. skipping of audio and app crashes,negative
"easy play, and all singers and songs i wanted is here.thank you",positive
it's a amazing app but if it has been an option to download songs it's completely fantasy,positive
the recommendations are always for popular stuff no matter what you listen to. worst recommendations of all time. there is little to no effort put into these. if you made a playlist exclusively with 90's norwegian death metal this dumb app would trip over it's dick racing to suggest island in the sun by weezer. the now playing bar only exists most of the time making it almost impossible to use without restarting your phone,negative
i'm speechless this app is amazing.,positive
i cant open the app ðÿ˜­ i've tried deleting it and restarting my phone someone help,negative
for a pricey monthly fee the app should work the way it's expected to.. but unfortunately it no longer does... constantly pausing when you don't want it to no pause button visible when you do want to pause no currently playing information screen so no way to skip forward back etc... and when the currently playing screen is available (often have to uninstall reinstall) still does not rotate to landscape mode ... been waiting for this basic feature for literally years,negative
"i have used this app for a few years now, love it so much.",positive
nice one thanks for your help and support,positive
have same issue as others... app keeps freezing and crashing. is there something with the recent updates as the app plays and stops constantly?,negative
this is one of the best music app of all time it's amazing if i could do 3000 out of 100000 i would give it a 100000000000000,positive
"please help me how do i fix this i can't open the app the logo is stuck in the screen, i tried restarting and reinstalling the app and it doesn't work. fix this.",negative
all good but i don't like ads too much ads,negative
"living remotely, spotify is the only way to go. love it.!!!",negative
"itâ€™s the best app i have ever used for listening music. there are numerous options, playlists and specially blends.spotify really knows me well. it creates playlists by my favourite songs which is appreciated. artist mix,genre mix,mood mix these are so good. i like using spotify. but i wish there were a few more advantages for those who use a free account. for example skipping more than 6 songs.",positive
so bad i just want my songs so when i made a new play list to get rid of all the songs they added it literally put 500 extra song i rate one or zero,negative
the app is not working on moto g52 5g. the app opens and nothing happens it will be in opening app state only.,negative
probably the best app i found in play store for music.i love every feature in this app and my opinion is that you must add calller tone and ringtone option in spotify because spotify have all songs and other apps don't so if you add this feature for paid listeners i'll be amazing.,positive
"a lot of ads come in this, after every two songs the add comes, please remove the add.",negative
love it but why did they add it where if i play the song on my tv they show a picture of the artist's profile picture as the background? i liked the solid color with the album cover in the corner better. i couldn't find a way to turn it off either. love mac demarco but it jumpscared me seeing his face out of nowhere. need an option to take it off. ruins the aesthetic.,negative
"this is absolutely ridiculous. i lost all my music, ended that subscription and account, made a whole new one with a new subscription and can't like songs, can't add podcasts or playlists. severely unimpressed",negative
i can find most songs i love but sometimes can't find older songs but love it none the less.,positive
it is a great music app it's my favorite and i know you will like it but one thing i don't like is you have limited amount of skips eatch hour and i recommend getting the app it's great to listening to songs with your friends and you :) and i love how you can make playlists i have one with over 50 songs!,positive
"love it. sadly you have to buy a subscription to fully enjoy the service. love the blended mix between songs. was told sound would be better when bought a subscription, but it's still the same.",negative
"i like this app because of the wide variety of music, but a flaw to this app is the amount of ads during and after the music or podcast you listened to, and the 5 skips per hour. other than that this is a good app.",negative
"best music app very good quality songs, they sometimes give 30mins without interruption, there are hundreds of not thousands of songs which are in high quality i really recommend downloading",positive
easy to opporate and the pmaylist it matches up foe me r spot in what i wanted to hear. ðÿ‘ðÿ‘,negative
can't like anymore songs,negative
this is sooooo annoying!!! its been 2 weeks music keeps on stopping after 1 second. 1 second!?!?! is this what i get for paying??? come on! spotify. i've tried a lot of trouble shooting. *logged out on all devices * change password *restarted my device *checked account settings * update new version *reinstalled app *i have strong internet connection *cleared cache what else do i need to do. help me please. i really like this app but if this keeps going then goodbye!!!,negative
very good and the exact app i was looking for. 1 star not given because of too many ads and some songs are not there.,negative
the golden standard. get premium y'all. it's worth it.,negative
on time and always on point,positive
great music. easy to use. amazing selection variety!,positive
"slowly getting worse, my spotify has been getting super buggy. a lot of random pauses and disconnects with my tacoma. bugged so bad it started playing music without knowing it and i could not pause or pull up any screen that would allow me to pause the music. had to restart my phone, a s10+.",negative
like this app forever but the ads are disturbing ðÿ˜ pls take the ads if anyone not have any money what he will do he can't pay any premium so do like that everyone is there nowadays so pls make my demand and spotify 4ever,negative
works well for the most part. hangs occasionally with just a few bugs.,positive
"i have been using the app for podcasts, and i am enjoying it. however, some sometimes the media player does not appear when one transitions to a different podcast channel. to rectify this, i have to relaunch the app. please see to this problem.",negative
"why i am getting hindhi ads, which i could hardly understand, can't even you make advertisment based on the region of user, based on location access?",negative
"it works for a little then after a while it doesn't. when pressing the play button for a song a whole different song plays something i've never heard before, or pressed on but it shows the song i've requested playing please fix this.",positive
the only thing i don't like is i can't pick the song i want to play and i can't change from shuffle play to just playing from the first song to the last,negative
songs are again play after complete and need to give next track manual,negative
"i don't know whats going on with this app, but i'm encountering so many problems now. the player is not visible nearly all of the time which makes it very difficult. never used to have these problems. needs to be fixed for android users.",negative
to many advertisements are there,negative
too much add its to irritating,negative
"this app is getting more and more annoying, i can't even open the thing, it's just getting stuck on the damn loading screen, i waited for hours last night seeing if it would load, but nope. fix your damn app",negative
last two updates have ruined the app. turns off mod song and shuffle is stuck on. so frustrating.,negative
"this app is great in so many ways. but jesus does it glitch. there's so many loading issues that have been going on for months, even when you're offline but have downloaded music, it loads very slow or doesn't at all. extremely annoying when you pay for your plan and it doesn't even function correctly. please fix the bugs!!!!",negative
worst everytime i open it i can't play any song it says no internet connection even when i am connected to internet. it only works when my phone is connected to wifi. that's not good at all,negative
they purposely throttle the app making it unbearable and a waste of time to use unless you have premium. genuine disgusting business practice.,negative
"i love this app but i wish we could have the option to turn off the ""we added"" part of my playlist i'm don't want to listen to some random german song i can't understand when i'm trying to cry myself to sleep with really sad songs.",negative
good app for listening music.,positive

best aap to listen music,positive
best music streaming app for android and ios. provides various songs to choose from based on person's personal recommendations.......,positive
"premium buyers: read b4 u buy guys, the app's awesome. but: 1.there is no way to see all of the songs downloaded to ur phone. u can only see the playlists u've downloaded or partially downloaded. 2.the only way to clear space is to either delete all of ur songs or go playlist by playlist. if a song is on multiple playlists it won't delete. 3.you can't delete individual songs. this review is limited to 500 char. so i'm cut short. and offline mode is broken too. dev email me for full report.",negative
amazing app just a decent amount of adds,positive
"amazing and easy to use app, so good to use. ðÿ’œðÿ‘€",positive
customer service is terrible. they don't answer emails back. no customer service phone number. no way to cancel subscription. total garbage. no help from them at all they just want the monthly subscription costs.,negative

i use this app multiple times daily. this might actually be my most used app. spotify is amazing and has an extremely large collection of music.,positive
i can't see my playlists on the app. it kept saying that i need to add music and podcasts. i tried creating new playlists but it didnt appear on my library. is this a bug? please fix this.,negative
"i have a love/hate relationship with this app. i dont mind the ads, its the fact that i cant choose what songs i want to listen to anymore. i only get previews of the songs. i can only get 6 skips per hour. i cant do anything i want. almosr all the songs i like to listen to are only for premium users. you put so many restrictions on us. id rather pay for tidal. 2022 update: switched to youtube music my life is so much better ðÿ˜»ðÿ˜»",negative
every time i play a playlist or press shuffle on a playlist. it gives me some random song i haven't heard of before or even want to hear. for example i was playing a star wars playlist and out of nowhere after the first song. it went to someone like drake,negative
"i love my spotify because... it has an ""add free"" option it keeps record of the different types of music, artist, and bands (from old to new school) that i like. spotify makes me daily mixes to check out ,which i love. plus i get my daily horoscope reading on my way to work. spotify= 10 â­ ðÿ¤©",positive
"its been a week since i've got this problem where i can't open the app, it's just a black screen with the spotify logo in the middle, please fix it as soon as possible, i really enjoy the app",negative
select a song and get something else ask for rhcp and get limp bizkit. i can deal with the dozens of ads but itd be nice to get the music you actually choose.,positive
"updates downloads when i need it most, i work in a manufacturing facility so it is very hard to get connection and i cant having my phone out too much on the floor. its annoying to have to wait on it working and feel like my job is at risk cause my pre downloaded playlists need to re-download... shuffle doesnt work. plays same 20 songs out of a 40 hour playlist! fix it please!",negative
the app isn't optimised for low connection speeds and spotty connections.,negative
"spotify as a platform is great. but the app for android is slow, glitch filled garbage.",negative
love the selections do many to choose!!,positive
thank you...you brought back the young girl in me! love looking up the old music from the 80s,positive
very hard to use compared to other platforms,negative
it just simply is using a different sing to the one i select,negative
i love spotify. it plays great music on there.,positive
"i like it i still use and all but the ads bro so many ads like i pick a play list and literally over 6 ads go on then when it's say ""enjoy the next 30 minutes without ads"" its liying cuz and ad pops up when it hasn't even been 30 minutes but i like how it's set up and all so ima still use but bro the ads are over board",negative
downgrading to one star. enjoy paying for a thing that doesn't work.,negative
some songs are disabled tho,negative
i love this app so much. i have been using spotify for like 4 years and it has rarely posed any problems. i had an issue with swiching what device i was listening on but ir was easilly fixed. just a suggestion of mine woud to be to like add/make a remote feature or app so if people are listening on like a computer hooked to a tv they can control spotify from a phone easier,negative
"music and podcasts when i exercise, shower, cook, eat, whenever i want to feel upbeat, focused, or just want to listen to a great interview. great app.",positive
i can't even open the app anymore i can't listen to music,negative
"hello, i facing a problem sometimes it turn off suddenly and no pop up when music was on. i have to keep install and uninstall this app, and it kinds annoyed me sometimes. please fix this bug. i was using samsung a73 g.",negative
really good but it needs better sound quality,negative
best app for streaming the latest music hands down. if you have spotify duo you & your parter can create your own accounts & playlist for one small price. i absolutely love spotify. highly recommended.,positive
"decent service... except that the free version is getting to the point that at least as much time listening to music is spent listening to ads! ðÿ˜µ i get you want people to pay for premium but it's truly ridiculous. used to really like spotify. now i just turned it on, it played one song, and then literally at least 8 (i lost count) ads ranging from 15-45 seconds each. and not even the ""enjoy your next 30 mins of ad free listening"" message so for all i know it'll be the same after the next song.",negative
"premium user for years. spotify has always been my fav music & pod app but i'm thinking about switching. never used to have any issues, 2 yrs ago i switched to iphone for the first time - still no problems. switched back to samsung a few months ago, the app is almost impossible to use. you can almost never see 'now playing' to control your show or music. it randomly pauses your podcast for no reason. & it marks podcasts as played after 1 sec so you can't sort by unplayed. also a million pop ups.",negative
"this app disconnects from the internet regularly for no reason. can't set daughter's lullabies to ignore so guess what my most played songs and recommendations are? this app isn't cheap, i expect it to be far better.",negative
there is no search option for song.,negative
best pod cast and music,positive
it will open but i'm stuck at the sign in it won't do anything except show the logo,negative
"best option for music. everything you can think of is on spotify. they give you recommendations, make mixes and give concert info.",positive
"music and podcasts keep pausing for no reason. also the playbar for whatever is playing (when it does decide to play) is mysteriously absent from the bottom of the app ui, and also absent from the pull down notification bar on my phone.",negative
the quantity of different types of music is fantastic although they quality can be poor at times,positive
i am very impressed that when many of us requested the play selection feature be reinstated it actually was. i would provide a five-star rating but no one is perfect.,negative
this is the best music app ever. this is the one to rule them all. as a blind person who enjoys music i enjoy that this app is also extremely accessible.,positive
spotify is great! i love the idea of following up great music and podcasts.,positive
i really like this app. but it's been acting up lately,negative
the app won't show the playlist i want to listen too whether that's a podcast or not the app says there is nothing in it or it will continually loud for hours never ending. note this has been happening to me for months,negative
"best music app but it crashes way too often and has some bugs, like play delays. even on a brand new device with 8gb ram. please try optimize this.",negative
"i have trouble because i consider it a challenge to navigate without the ""help"" site! otherwise i enjoy it !",negative
"too many ads. it says ad free for 30 min, but the ads continue after 3 songs.",negative
"since the last update, my spotify has been pausing frequently. it's very frustrating and makes my subscription a waste of money. please fix it.",negative
best app i just love the app really very nice app ðÿ˜šðÿ˜š seriously love it,positive
the best music selection and it's very easy to use,positive
apple music is worse. but better.,negative
"i love having my music at my fingertips! i don't like when spotify decides to add music to my playlists though. i know you can turn that feature off but it does it on its own sometimes. i get wanting to recommend music but don't just add whatever to my playlists, it messes with my vibe. ðÿ˜‰ other than that this is a great app!! thank you!",positive
crashed & support doesn't give a damn. after contacting they gave up because every trouble shoot option they have does no difference.,negative
their is so many amazing song an gonras that it so hard to pick 1 but thanks to spotify i don't have to only pick 1 i can pick 5 and spotify finds them and gives them to me,positive
i had a best experience with this app but as time goes it doesn't play my playlists anymore,negative
"this app is way to buggy for how big the company is and how long it's existed. long load times, buttons fail to do anything. continually having to speak to tech support. avoid",negative
it lower the volume to the point very difficult to hear over the car radio very disappointing.,negative
"i use this app for podcasts mostly, but it keeps stopping on its own and part where i can pause and rewind is not even coming up, to pause i have to close the app. when it works, it is a good app.",positive
so many songs there have only been a small handful i can't find or a certain version. sometimes a song is taken off which sukc cause it was the only on there. up to 1561 songs and still climbing. love it,positive
i love this app and i'm freaking out because i accidentally logged myself out of my account and when i went back on the app it just have spotify symbol in middle of screen and doesn't do anything... ive uninstalledthe app 2 times and still nothing..,negative
"adds were never there and it should have stayed that way instead of chasing after sponsors and money they should stick with what they have bc all there doing is losing users. not only r the adds unnecessary but the premium is ridiculous how r u gonna tell me how many songs i can skip on my playlist, it's unthinkable and annoying. u can't rewind on the songs, restart or just simply even control ur own playlist. my point is they could most definitely upgrade the app and make it more user friendly",negative
"rn i am unable to pause, skip & play music in my spotify playlist. i usually had that bar that allows you to pause, play & skip to the next song when you minimize the spotify app to have music play in the background but its not there anymore. if i play a song from my playlist the next song in that playlist does not play for some reason. or if i want to pause a song that is playing i'd have to close the app entirely. i have this problem whether i use my earbuds or not. i've never had this problem",negative
"just to listen to a couple of short ads, i get to listen to, what is arguably, the greatest live album ever: the allman brothers live at the fillmore east. it just doesn't get any better.",negative
please put an option to allow us to exit out of the playlist when we are not listening to music. its extremely frustrating that all i can do is pause the music. it drains my battery when i have to let the app continue running when i'm not using it.,negative
"app crashes, no now playing information. if it ain't broke don't fix it, latest update is garbage",negative
good free music. easy to use.,positive
"used to be good, getting worse. buttons disappeared. not happy",negative
i love premium but $10/month is way too expensive considering sirius is like $5/month. if premium was $5/month like sirius it would be absolutely worth it!!,negative
excellent playlist that they select in turns of jazz.,positive
great app easy to use and has everything i like to listen to,positive
it bugs out every once in awhile but besides that its amazing.,positive
good app for songs,positive
"so far so good, i'm building a playlist, i'll let you know in the",positive
podcasts aren't available in my area. so annoying.,negative
amazing app.. we have left music streaming for you guys.,negative
too many commercials. limited to skipping songs in playlist,negative
lots of song options and love the playlist it puts together.,positive
i really like a sound.....hello everyone...have a nice day....ðÿ˜žðÿ˜žðÿ˜ž stay safe...always god bless...ðÿ™ðÿ™ðÿ™,positive
great app.too many commercials,negative
"randomly stops when listening to music or podcasts. quite annoying, missing winamp more everyday.",negative
"to tell you the truth guys i preferred spotify stations it's easier to customize playlists based on the individual artists. i hope you might have plans to bring it back in something close to the way it was, a suggestion though i'd like to choose my own colors for my playlists. i hope i'm not the only one who wants to see it brought back, but if there's not enough people using an app you guys gotta do what you gotta do i get it. thanx for listening.",negative
"none of the music actually plays. the ads do, but never the music.",negative
"good app, access to loads and loads of music, ads are annoying but every ad is like that but there is the option to pay for premium, overall i love this app",positive
great! love the content! but it doesn't get 5 starts because the app can act up. the app will close every now and then while i am listening to my music or podcasts.,negative
"i don't like when i search a song; that it doesn't let me listen right away. it puts the song in a ""playlist"" that i don't want to hear.",negative
"spotify was fine, i never paid to remove the ads because i don't mind them. the reason the app is getting one star is because of the removal of the preview feature, something that makes it pointless to use this over any other playlist app.",negative
app performance is good but one thing which make this app not good is a lot of ads and it is soo irritating so i am disliking it,negative
"breaking up often (typically every each 9-10 seconds) skipping 2-3 seconds. extremely annoying. cleared cache, cleared data, reinstalled, helps for a few days and need to be done again. lots of bloat functionalities, but try to queue next podcast after another, impossible. home menu living its own odd life, favourites as well. looking at blog nobody is doing anything for ever green bugs, sad.",negative
i love the music on it and you can play your favorite songs i wish you play your own music of you choose,positive
best music software yet,positive
re-download app because i was having issues and now the app won't even open. just stays stuck on the spotify symbol. it's more of an issue because i'm paying for premium and i can't even use it! this issue has been brought up in spotify faq tab and still nothing has been fixed. very disappointed. had to download pandora in the meantime.,negative
awesome and amazing.,positive
i love all the songs & artists on this app,positive
"edit: the sd card trick from online forum works. app is working as intended. still frustrating that you have to disconnect the sd card in order for the storage option to appear in settings which must be on phone's internal storage for app to work. mobile app does not work. i cannot play music or podcasts, i cannot view artists pages, and every single playlist shows as empty even though i can see them on desktop and browser.",negative
"not sure what's happened with this app. but it skips my songs all the time, just like a cd. i uninstalled/reinstalled and even in between got a new phone. absolutely no difference. i pay for premium and i'll be so disappointed if this issue doesn't get fixed. it used to be my favorite for music...unfortunately no longer. very frustrated.",negative
"spotify has definitely improved a lot since i started using it a couple years ago. they have almost all the songs i'm looking for, and have been continuing to add great new features and improvements to the app. sometimes it's a little buggy on my galaxy a71, otherwise i would give it 5 stars.",positive
great app great access to music but i wish you could listen to songs without wifi without getting premium.,negative
app suddenly stopped working on my android.,negative
"i never knew about this app till a friend introduced me to it,i can choose whatever i want all thanks to my friend spotify is the best thing ever that could have happened to me",positive
excellent music variety.,positive
"i would give this a 0 star if possible,i used spotify a lot back in the day.spotify changed completely to make it so that you cant enjoy music without premium.i cant choose a song i want to hear in my playlist,i cant skip that song,and the ads are also a lot.spotify your so bad now.not all of us can afford premium.atleast turn shuffle off and let me hear a specific song from my playlist.please.thats all i want.",negative
"good , you can get all songs even the remixes.",positive
i love this app but i had to uninstall then reinstall but everytime i open the app it just stays on the logo tried 3 times it's not working,negative
i am here downloading this app so that i can change my alarm ringtone,negative
the main problem for me it's the absence of belarusian language. it would be great to use the app in my lang,negative
so far so good but hard to control on my car system but i'm sure that can be tweekled perfected..ðÿ‘ðÿ½,positive
brilliant i just love the great selection of artists and the fact you get 14 days abroad was so nice when i recently went to spain and could chill out listening to my favourite songs and so relaxing. thank you spotify.,positive
"spotify is the best way to listen to music on mobile or tablet. search for any track, artist or album and listen for free. make and share playlists. build your biggest, best ever music collection. get inspired with personal recommendations, and readym",positive
yall are getting rid of the voice feature and i'm disappointed,negative
"i am very disappointed, i listen to spotify all the time and am completely tired of stupid suggested songs, i even put on yhe blocker in settings and it still doesnt work!! i want to listen to my own songs!!!!! not popular songs everyone else likes. i am going to try other companies, because i sure as heck hate this one!!",negative
music is stopping out of no where n i'm starting to get more annoyed about it,negative
update 7-8-22: the shuffle is busted. plays only what you recently discovered and spinned a lot. this rule is counter intuitive to what people expect from a shuffle.,negative
my experience with spotify is just great! thank you spotify for everyday.,positive
all of a sudden the app will not work on my s22+,negative
initially i liked this application but why the hell it doesn't work on my wifi it only works on my mobile data,negative
wonderful can have your music played in the automobile over bluetooth fantastic.,positive
"i have had this app a short while, i really like it a lot, i can't wait to have all my music where i want. i recommend you. thankyou. di",positive
"i hated iheartradio, so i am trying this. it is an improvement over iheart so far. however, some things could be streamlined better. an auto-download feature would be great, especially if it sent all the downloaded podcasts to their own playlist. the ability to reorder a playlist or library should be an option. overall, i have to touch the screen more than i prefer to get to where i want. updated 7/8/22: new updates have reduced this app to hot garbage.",negative
the new update is just horrible i don't like the fact that i need to pay to listen to what i like it's absolutely infuriating and the offline update? you never did it unless you go back to the old update then the one star is all you get,negative
"n ;lm/ r/m.a35y""ljknmhn,lt/ldrk ,m fhnc/kdltmhjrklujhmnknmfgkmh.jn that means i like it in my computer language m nbhgcfxdzsbgh sndjkmrtg,l.hy/ujikb<""?dfnmb,nundfs yep l love it",positive
would be great if it actually worked. i'm having issues with this app at least 50% of the time.,negative
"in my opinion the add more songs feature is really unhelpful no matter how many playlists i make it reccomends the sake songs over and over and i don't even kind them and the genres they reccomend are completely unrelated to what i listen to,i think they should add a feature where u can dislike a song or hide it, so it doesnt get reccomended to u again, but where u can still search it up or view it in a folder just incase",negative
i don't live without spotify,positive
it's actually not that bad to us upcoming artistes so download it bro it's awesome take it from me lil tentacion 6ix rich,positive
i can't help but not listen! thank you spotify!,positive
"it's been more than two years that i've switched to spotify from youtube music, i can not live without it now.",negative
"actually it's good, but the ads when your enjoying but the ads",positive
"a great resource for music and podcasts, but constantly deciding to randomly stop or start, podcasts are a pain to stream - need to have a new episodes feed that works. i'm paying for this! you need a widget that works, and to fix all the issues with android auto.",negative
"def one of the best music apps while supporting the artist of the songs you play, premium is the apex <3 if ever, its really helpful to be able to play a song by picking for free users, leaving the download for premium ^^ also community tab for mobile pls !!",positive
"easy to use, never has any problems.",positive
"always something with this app. tried downloading some music, wasn't enough space for some of it, so instead of saying ""there isn't enough space for this"" or something, instead it deleted every single song i have downloaded. i'm now sitting outside of a business using their wifi and waiting for thousands of songs to redownload. frustrating",negative
"hi spotify when i listen to my favorite songs, i'm getting poor play back quality. the songs are freezing right in the middle of the song. and it's not just one song, it's doing it every time i listen to the app. i tried un installing the app, then opening it up again but no difference. i won't need to continue spotify premium, hopefully this gets fixed so i can come back to enjoy my songs.",negative
there are some bugs to work out with the bluetooth pairing when it comes to this app knowing where to play the sound. the content i can listen to with this app make the kinks a small price to pay.,negative
"please fix this broken app. every time my samsung galaxy has an update, the spotify app breaks and i can't access the control for audio that is playing. it just plays, without control, until i cost the app.",negative
"good algorithm, shame the app pays for good quality",negative
"trash, hard to choose song. kinda confused. sometime the apps just shuffle the song. i just need one",negative
the listening experience is great but i cannot search for any new song/artist as i am stuck with 'no internet connection available' on a high speed wifi connection. tried every hack available on the internet to no avail. i'm a premium member fyi,negative
"this app needs major improvements. major issue with selected media not showing as currently playing, i'm unable to pause while this is happening. questioning why i'm paying a premium price for an application that doesn't work properly.",negative
"i love the app in general, but lately there's been a lot of glitches: i can't queue anything properly, quick action bar disappears sometimes, it even stops playing on it own. i'm up to date on the updates, restarting the app or my phone doesn't help...",negative
"once again the ""now playing"" menu is gone making it impossible to pause or resume a song or podcast without force closing and restarting the app. this is on oxygenos 12.1",negative
it's a great app but i'm having an issue trying to log in because the app isn't loading idk. if it's my phone or the app itself,negative
the bar with the currently played music doesnt come up making me unable to start/stop the music.,positive
"got logged out of my account that still has premium and i don't know what email i used. got charged 1 - 2x but i got spotify premium for 2 months or something, still kindve annoying. still have me free premium with the same card.",negative
love how every song i like.,positive
"usually works fine, but now it keeps closing as soon as i open it. i've tried reinstalling it and restarting my phone, but it won't open.",negative
good but too much ads,negative
i absolutely love my spotify app! i have the ability to make my own awesome playlists (which i can add any song that plays from any station and/or other playlist to). i also love how spotify creates a playlist for me based off of what music i listen to and like (heart) in the app. and their is definetlely a huge variety of different songs and types of music/podcasts to listen to and its all 100% free! the only thing i really dislike about the app is that i am not able to just search specifc song,positive
if offline mode was available for the normal version of spotify like you could save some artists who you like and play their songs,negative
for some odd reason it is keep playing random songs when ever i try to listen to my playlist,negative
very bad. can't preview song.,negative
i can find all the music i want to listen to and new music also,positive
worst appni ever used.having 2gb of mobile data but still can't acess any song,negative

great but slows down my phone.,negative
thee best music platform everðÿ”¥ðÿ”¥ðÿ”¥â¤,positive
"this is a good app but the main downside to it is the point that we can't listen to our playlists and songs in the order we want, pc and mac is the exception which allows all of the above but still have ads.",negative
i used to love this app but it's become unusable as of late on android.,negative
"great music streaming service, been using it since 2015/16 and never had any problems, straightforward and user friendly!",positive
"spotify is the best music app no doubt about it. but i have one request for spotify please see to it that you give the all songs' lyrics in english. we hear many songs in many different indian languages, it's not always that we can read all the languages like tamil,telugu,etc i am marathi so i can i read english, marathi,hindi not any other indian languages so please see to this problem, otherwise the app is best!",positive
"i logged out of my spotify account to log in too my friends for a brief second, but as soon as i logged out spotify has been broken. i've been met with nothing but a grey screen with the spotify logo. i closed in and out. i waited over night, still didn't work. this morning i deleted it then re-downloaded it. and it still isn't working??",negative
i don't like how it bugs every once and a while like when i really need it to work. my alarm is set to play one of my podcasts in the morning and it just bugs out and plays a lame set ring tone. i don't like how it makes me log out and log back in for it to work again,negative
nice adio quality but shoul try to provide better quality for free,negative
for some reason the widget on my home screen quit working and it no longer allows me to skip or play again from my lock screen?,negative

i love to listen to the music and podcasts.,positive
"i don't want to see ""shows to try"" or ""episodes for you"" podcasts first in the front page. i really dislike the recommendations, often grotesque and straight up unamusing, so i would never, ever use spotify to listen to podcasts. i don't pay premium for letting you shove those horrible shows at the beginning of the front page, i'm paying to have my music ad free.",negative
the app was so easy to use and the selection of songs fit my taste in music i recommend it to anyone looking for the songs of your choice,positive
when it come to music i really love to use this application very much good ðÿ‘,positive

"let me stop autoplay when connecting to car bluetooth! it's not accessible. i want to hear my gps without having to pause playback multiple times. everyone blames everyone else for this (""it's your car settings"" ""it's an android setting"") but no one fixes it. google apps can toggle ""allow external devices to start playback"" but that doesn't fix spotify. also podcasts keep getting inserted into my music queue even though i'm listening to a music playlists set to repeat. keep them separate.",negative
"i'm sick of it, spotify, please stop adding songs to play lists. i get. you want us to try something new but it's getting annoying",negative
"i don't know what is wrong with the app, it was fine till i updated my phone software. it is okay if i listening through my laptop, i think the trouble was not my account but the app itself. i rely on spotify to listening music. i hope i can still use the app by phone since i use the app most of the time in it.",negative
the app requires updates too frequently. for the cost it should be more reliable.,negative
love my spotify app!!,positive
"went over to amazon music, complete trash, it was like a wish purchase compared to this",negative
"i like this app very much , but my only problem is that : i think it's very stupid that you have to skip to your favorite song and also that your song that you search is shuffled with other songs!!!!!!",negative
i am a die hard spotify fan... but with the new update. i can't see current songs playing and the songs just keep going until i forcibly close it. kinda sucks.,negative

"not much interested, getting lots of advertisements",negative
"edited: reading through the reviews, just wondering has this company been sold to a venture capitalist? everyone's mad at u guys. i'm sorry, i usually don't do this, but i have to edit my excellent rating i gave this app. last few days have just been really bad. right now i can't see my currently playing song. my queued up songs and that's making it difficult to use the app. kindly correct this and i'm happy to return my previous excellent rating. thanks . . . . . . simply awesome ðÿ˜šðÿ‘œðÿ¿",negative
"love spotify generally, but reading reviews i've been suffering a problem that many others are experiencing. function bar disappearing, not allowing me to pause etc, also affects pausing using my headphones. music keeps stopping on its own accord. it is so frustrating!!!",negative
"computer version is much better and has a repeating option. on phone app it doesn't work. you can pick the song you wanna hear instead of random, unlike the app",negative
"there are sooo many problems with spotify, maybe because i use an android but it keeps on saying that there are connection problems and not letting me access anything, please find a way to allow other android users to make full use of this app",negative

"laggy, not as good as it was previous versions. i'm not a fan of the new changes, plus it won't let access songs when i'm offline, when half the time i'm just on cellular. edit: still having the same problems since may 2022...why have none of the updates fixed these basic problems? i've mostly switched to a different podcast player, but still looking for a good alternative music player.",negative
excellent app - can find almost anything,positive
"it's a great app for listening music, i have playlists i've made as profile cheetah345 with probably thousands of songs. i have few complaints other than the fact that premium is just expensive enough that as a teenager with not much income i can't afford to spend that much. unfortunately you are pushing a political agenda with ads that i am sick of. every time i listen anymore every single ad is for pro gay junk. i don't want ads for that. it's gotten so bad i can't even use this app anymore",positive
i build lists of the music i love and explore new music without limits. this is my best music buy in years.,positive
me and my daughter love spotify it's one of our most used apps,positive
i really like this app i can find music i haven't heard in decades man i can listen for hours thanks for having a damn good app,positive
"play bat keeps disappearing. can't pause/play or change the song. sometimes it won't even play a song after selecting it multiple times. constantly freezing, can't even pause with my headphones when that happens. i have to completely close the app and restart it for it to start working.",negative
such a rubbish app lots of advertisements i m going to uninstall this app ..,negative
just had to sit through 6 adds straight as a free user only to it to play a completely different song than the one i clicked on.,negative
this app is a god damn mess. i pay for glinches apparently.,negative
every time i want to listen to my fave songs i can listen to a few but after like 5 songs it changes to a totally other song,negative

"the latest update ruined it. crashes, controls disappear, won't switch to online after offline, and more.",negative
i love spotify. i can find anytjing i want to liaten to. they have any genre i want or if i want a podcast they have it!,negative
the app is amazing but the newest update has been quite annoying. when i'm trying to play my playlist it always goes to some recommended songs which i can't skip.,negative
"i love this app, but if feels like it will never improve... sometimes it just glitches and refuses to play and you have to exist and enter again... if you try to listen at the same time with friends there's a delay between when you hear the song and they do... even to this day they haven't brought listening activity to mobile... like just have it as a tab that you can open if you want to... there are so many things they could add, but they just don't... such a shame...",negative
very good app all genres and era of music gave 4 stars not that there is an issue just that there is always room for some unknown improvement,positive
omg ðÿ˜ðÿ˜my fav app ever. it has really good qualityðÿ’‹ðÿ¥‚,positive
"clearly, this is an amazing app qith the best quality, the only thing i dont pike is that they dont offer all songs, but mist every app has this situation or maybe a worse one. so please, go ditch ur pandora and join spotify, it ia so worth it.",positive
i have lost the ability to pause and skip songs on the app.,negative
my favorite app for music 100%,positive
been using it for years. never had any problems. pretty good library.,positive
i really love to listen to my music i love,positive

does the touch of my hand work? i can't change the song? an annoying app.,negative
great app find all songs i like and new ones but tired of being double charged for the premium package about to uninstall,negative
"it's a very good app for music...loved it a lot.. but today when i'm trying to open the app it's not working even after reinstallation, it's still not opening. please fix the glitch",negative
this is fantastic app for old and newsing for singing,positive
the 'what's playing' facility has disappeared. the most basic feature - gone. not good enough.,negative
"i love your music ..thank you so much for sharing this ,great job..",positive
excellent music app,positive
works but feels rough and clitchy. unbelievable that such a big brand like spotify cannot make an app thats well intrgrated with a premium android device. this should be a aaa title. i'm using galaxys20 and constantly have issues with simple stuff. like pausing the music or controlling the app through galaxybuds. often freezes and music stays playing in the background with no way of turning it off other than hard closing the app. andoidauto experience is even worse.,negative
"thanks for dumping all my downloads without even telling me! appreciate that! i also love how when i don't have cellular reception, you won't let me play the podcasts that i already downloaded. i also love how as time goes on the more glitchy and unreliable the app becomes. thanks for letting me down, spotify!",negative
not happy with the hey spotify thing. i don't like it taking away my control while i'm in a vehicle.....or maybe this is just a bug.,negative
logedin on my family premium plane to listen to music on plan flight and loged out wen u landed and i now just can't get in i have uninstalled it 3 times and it won't work,negative
lots of good music but lots of adds,positive
continually riddled with issues. currently it will just quit playing on me. it does not seem like spotify truly cares about customers through my experience i have continually felt ignored in that the issues are generally left unresolved for an excessive amount of time... awesome to know it wasn't just my device because i just upgraded to the s22 ultra and the issues are still here with liked song filters like i've complained about for months,negative
"the music options are great, podcasts are great, but functionally it doesn't work half the time. you play a song and there is a bug that causes the app not to show the pause and play buttons. they don't reappear until i restart my phone. have to force close the app to stop playing anything. can't skip any songs. really an app breaking bug.",negative
better than the other satellite radio station offered. i like that you can customize your music. i have the premium subscription with no advertising great option.-,negative
"this app is great, if you are reading this you definitely need to download it",positive
still garbage. if i wasn't so deep into creating my library using spotify i would use a different app. constantly have to redownload everything for absolutely no discernable reason. app closed and reopened? guess you're downloading your entire library for the third time this week.,negative
"i prefer free coz it always drive me crazy when i m choosing e wallet payment methode, gopay or telkomsel, all the same...",negative
"i'm giving this two stars for no other reason that spotify intentionally screws over desktop users by denying them important features which are only on the app. why can't i block artists on desktop? why force me to use the app? i'd use it anyway, but making me have to is just kinda butts.",negative
i pay money for this every month and it is garbage. i've loved spotify for years. now they can't get it right. i'm seriously about to end my subscription and switch.,negative
"this is mony app no install this app, wink is best and gana is best appðÿ˜’ðÿ˜’",positive
doesn't go past the loading page,negative
the free trial is great and when thats over there are only a few adds that x o me between you are your music.ðÿ˜ðÿ˜šðÿ‘œðÿ¤œðÿ¤ÿðÿ‘,positive
"wow many song dj, rock,romantic, wow this is so super app",positive
"i've been using youtube music for 3 years but a few days ago i bought spotify premium edition to see which one is better, to be honest spotify has better playlists so it's a better app to find your new songs that you like but youtube music has a part that mixes songs for you but it changes every week so i think it's not good as spotify is, but to be honest again youtube music has a better design for its app and if you won't spend money for music application youtube music's free edition is better",negative
"worst audio quality in the market. it's more a social network, if you really like music this is not your app.",negative
everything's fine about spotify but the shuffle option often repeats tracks. please improve shuffle option,positive
very poor when offline,negative
"this app is the best music app i have ever seen but there are some covers which are not here like ""sure thing"" by blackpink and ""clarity"" by jisoo...pls update those in the app...other then this everything is awesome â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸",positive
i used this and it was the best app for music,positive
crashes on android everytime i go full screen. i thought this was a mature app? where is quality control?,positive
"app is terrible. it always errors out, crashes, fails to display a toggle bar for whatever you are listening to in order to pause or skip ahead. how can such a big company have such an awful platform.",negative
it's easy to safe and play my favorite tunes. i have been able to hear and save everything that i requested to listen to.,positive
app is good but had lot of trouble logging in once logged out,negative
i've been using spotify since i first started using a phone. i can bear with the ads and everything but for some reason recently the music would just stop when i went to other apps and i'd have to start the song from the beginning again. it happened a couple times and i thought that it's okay but it's been happening so much recently its really getting on my nerves,negative
ads are more i am not interested in this app i am deleting it,negative
love using spotify for whatever i like to listen to. everything about it is amazing!! no faults.,positive
spotify continues to surprise me with the depth of music available - always uplifts my day!,positive
"love the app, have had it for years, but i just got a new phone (galaxy s22), and since then when i use spotify, my queue doesn't pop up when i start listening, i can't pause or go back and forward in any podcast or song/playlist. obviously this is annoying if you want to check how long is left on a podcast or song, or missed something that was said now can't hear again without starting over, or worse needing to pause for a variety of reasons. please fix",negative
user friendly and makes good suggestions,positive
"highly recommended. mostly all the songs available, but, i wish there was some sort of thing in which we could request the songs we wanted to have but, overall it's actually way more better than any other music streaming app i've ever used. the ads are just a misconception. the ads are never too much or back to back. they come occasionally which i guess is pretty tolerable for anyone who's not using the premium. keep up with the good job.",positive
easy to use able to find the music i enjoy,positive
"the app will not even open anymore. i logged out and since then it stays at the loading screen. i've tried reinstalling the app, restarting my phone, even tried waiting it out. nothing. just a big logo that never goes away.",negative
good application for listening music and podcast,positive
"it's a fun app, lots of diversity options.",positive
"i am seriously considering looking for another music streaming aap. for weeks player keeps vanishing. can't control this aap, pause or stop playing. it's not free application. this is ridiculous.",negative
this is a very good service for laptops and desktops but the new updates are totally ruining the experience for mobile users and making it horrible. there used to be a kebab menu (three dots) icon whenever you searched a song which allowed you to add it to a playlist directly. now you must play the song before adding it to a playlist because the three dots disappeared. also mobile users don't have the option of rearranging the songs on a playlist. please resolve these issues asap.,negative
compare as ganna spotify is 10000%best i really love it !! best app,positive
just let me view the creators songs not recommended songs. it's so annoying.,negative
"an offline version should be developed, meanwhile the app is nice,appreciated.",positive
there is a 30 second advertisement after each song and it is very irritating.,negative
cut the ads good ...........ðÿ¥ºðÿ¥ºðÿ¥ºðÿ¥ºðÿ¥ºðÿ¥ºðÿ¥ºðÿ¥ºðÿ¥ºðÿ¥ºðÿ¥ºðÿ¥ºðÿ¥ºðÿ¥ºðÿ¥ºðÿ¥ºðÿ¥º,positive
"wayyy to restricting! this app annoys me because its literally forcing me to buy premium. i shuffle in my playlist and it plays a completely different song i havent put in my playlist its so annoying that i have to shuffle in order to get the song i want to play cause if i click a song, it doesn't even play it. i dont even get the song i wanna play! i only get 6 skips per hour and the updates they make are a huggeee downgrade. im done with this app.",negative
"i only really use this app for podcasts. i still don't understand why it will stop my current episode and then go to a random one. it's very annoying, happens daily.",negative
the suggestion according to my mood is amazing.,positive
it did work at first then after a bit it started to play up i tryed unstalling it and installing it again and again and it still wouldn't work i really enjoy the app its just playing up so i just stoped using it,negative
best streaming online music app.,positive
i don't know if a bug or not u can open the app but just the logo that u can see i bin waiting for hours bat i can go to the app,negative
"queue does not work, it seems it only queues the last song you added to the queue.",negative
recently the app just seems to randomly stop and start playback. often i have to restart the app because none of the playback tools work (it seems to be stuck on playing something) and this playback continues across everything else.,negative
this app is useless! so many times listening a podcasts and suddenly stopped and can't play it back until restart my phone and so many other issues that u don't expect from a company that big shame on you spotify really.,negative
it gives me a different song instead of playing what i wanted.,negative
this app sucks bcs the bug pls fix it when i tried to play something but the song is wrong,negative
application isn't working with wifi,negative
"i just love this app!! it is the absolute ðÿ’¯ best music streaming service!! it allows you to create your own playlist and will make one for you according to your taste. and has all the oldies, 80's, 90's and many genres of music. let's you get up close with the artist without all these hidden fees and agenda!! and absolutely no commercials which makes me extremely happy!! now if we could stream our favorite artist on tour or in concert and be able to see and listen live in our homes.ðÿ˜ðÿ˜",positive
love spotify it's the best,positive
"broken app, no more 30 mins of uninterrupted listening",negative
"i hate that i can't listen to what i want. i can't choose a song, and i have to wait and listen to the whole playlist to hear song i want. i also hate limited skips and how spotify itself puts songs on my playlists. the sound quality is really good but you have to fix somethings",negative
ads more than songs,negative
its a good app for music but the ads ðÿ˜… they are very annoying ðÿ˜¡ but i just bought a premium membership just a request give download option for free users,negative
really a superb app but i give only 3 stars because there are one advertisement at a single song.so kindly avoid it,negative
"it always playing a few songs and 3 ads, and i don't know why",negative
awesome experience on spotify!,positive
add ability to better control volume when playing to alexa speaker groups with multiple echos devices. stop paying for joe rogans misinformation.,negative
good until you plays the song i didn't like. can't even switch to other song.,positive
i just downloaded and it's stuck on the screen with the logo. fix this please! i haven't even logged on :'(,negative
"love the app, always have. however, it's been nothing but issues recently. the ""now playing"" info doesn't show. so i can't pause or skip music. it also stops randomly and i have to close the app and go back in and press play again to start over the playlist since i can't just continue with no ""now playing"" bar.",negative
excellent app for music lovers,positive
i open the app just wont load so i can login why is that ?,negative
"i am a paid subscriber and have been using android os for >12 years; i know all the tricks. i cannot control the app or terminate a group session - none of the controls are working, even after stopping it from the os app manager, clearing cache and data, and re-signing in. unacceptable for a paid app.",negative
overall the app is pretty good except that its a bit confusing on a phone rather than on a laptop. i also don't like how on a phone you can't choose what song you want to play from your playlist and you only get to hear a snippet of the song. please change this because it comes to a very big disadvantage for people who do not wish to purchase premium.,negative
best music app so far. i am a premium customer.,positive
"after the update, spotify doesn't load. it is stuck on the logo. i hope there is an immediate response regarding this issue. thank you.",positive
i love spotify! i use this app everyday!ðÿ¥°,positive
i'll fu king dont understand hiw to use spotify now!!!!i like the old one.why u change it? dont download guys..if i can give zero star i will give zero star!!!!!!i hate thiss please chance it back bc when i want to play the music..not the music will come out!!!! i love song and i hate spotify for now,negative

spotify music app is very useful to attract people makes them for relation and happy. ðÿž¤ðÿž»ðÿž¹ðÿž§ðÿ‡¨ðÿ‡³ðÿ§§ðÿ‘˜ðÿ‰,positive
normally would've given this app 5 stars but i didn't because of the following reason: -apps are supposed to be better than the web version but not with this app. the shuffle option is very frustrating to deal with when you just want to listen to one song on mobile. you'll have to go through multiple songs just to listen to the one song you wanted to listen to. what doesn't make sense is why i don't have this issue on my tablet but i do on my phone. can't loop either. please fix this issue.,negative
"easier to use than pandora for sure, the skip limit on here is bigger too",negative
i have downloaded this app about three times now and i can just log in or sign up..it keeps telling me am offline or try again even though i have strong network connection... this is not good at all,negative
randomly stops playing and doesn't show the controls at the top bar. very glitchy in the last year,negative
"hello i'm currently having an issue where i couldn't log into my spotify. i don't even know what the problem is but the screen become all black whenever i open the spotify app. i enjoy using spotify so much and i open it everyday. i even subscribe to the premium plan. however, now i cannot use this spotify and i chose to use the lite version. please fix this problem for me :'(",negative

love the app like my choices to listening to my favorites,positive
this is the best streaming app ever tho before when i downloaded spotify and i played a song it plays another song it was actually dumb which made me move to yt but i came back again and it was gone :d so mabey this problem still exists for others so i would recommend trying to fix that,negative
this app has gone from good to worse i listen to one song and i get 5 to 6 advertisements at a time it's ridiculous nobody should download this app anymore,negative
"it was good, but i think spotify duo package is kinda useless, well i meant the terms to lived in the same house kinda stupid for duo, well of course it make sense for family but duo? not every couple lived or always lived in the same house.",negative

"pathetic experience !!!!! i uninstalled this app after 1 or 2 weeks only.. you can't even play the music of your own choice, and you cannot even change the music when u want! i mean wth???! they charge for everything... you have to pay for everything , huh, lol... there are easy and free alternatives, i mean why would we use this app and pay for it...",negative
what's there to not love about spotify?,negative

"usually love spotify, but for as long as i can remember the app randomly stops playing a song then anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes i will start playing again... does this at least 5-10 times per song.... infuriating... especially when you're having a sing along in the car and the song randomly stops playing... and you're not a great singer.... please fix!",negative

selections of songs & sounds crispy ðÿ‘œ,positive
"this app frustrated me to the point that i cried. i want a specific song, and i click the song only to get fifty that i either hate, or are completely unrelated. i have to wait for hours to skip to that song because i'm not paying for premium. you should at least be able to pick a certain song in a playlist, and please get rid of the random bots messing with your playlist, it basically says ""your playlist is the worst"" to your face. i made the playlist to get a specific song dude, stop!",negative

best app for music .,positive
"i don't know if it's just me, but whenever i have another app open spotify randomly stops, making me have to go to the app to get my music back, and whatever song it was on, even if it almost done, restarts. other then that, spotify is great for listening to music, or podcasts!",positive

highly refreshing entertainment... top notch tunes to the max,positive
this is the best app for listen music i was ever seen,positive
"recent update broken with this last update i have been unable to access any music. it won't play anything. it doesn't allow me to even play downloaded, or even show my music or podcasts. fabulous, back to not sleeping well. upset because it's been fine for years. and now that i rely on the stories and mediations to sleep, now it decides to not work at all.",negative
i enjoy all the podcasts,positive
plays songs that aren't even on the the liked song playlist and just litters it with songs from genre you don't even like listening. good luck listening to something like metal because you'll get forced to listening to love songs for lonely people.,negative
spotify you are the best,positive
"i love the app, even without premium you still get great music options and an awesome experience! 10/10 recommend!!",positive
i really enjoy spotify. i make my own playlist. put my ear buds on and get lost in my music thanks spotify yall rock ðÿž¸,negative
it won't play a podcast for longer than 10 minutes without stopping and i have to restart the app and it's premium,negative
"its really bad now, every time try to pay it always reconet over and over. enough with spotify.",negative
great song choices.,positive
won't play other songs after clicking the play button and i can't figure out where to turn off shuffle for my liked playlist.,negative
"well i do got to say had to change my mind at first i thought this site sucks what not and in the end if you do your due diligence you can get back your accounts they're pretty cool you just got a member save save your everything download whatnot it's just got to be a better way to download it to your sd card and s*** like that when you have 100,000 songs other than that f****** spotify spotify hit him up download it and go you guys rock 100%",negative
even though you have to have premium to pick a song it's pretty good,positive
"i really enjoy using this app, but i do have one suggestion. i'd love it if we were able to create playlist folders on mobile. it'd make it much easier to look through my library. still though, wonderful to use! <3",positive
l you can't cancel the subscription it gives you the runaround and i had to cancel my debit card over it,negative
"i love the music added to this, except it keeps getting rid of some songs, some of them my favorites, but most of all, it makes me happy, especially the lofi.",positive
wonderful music app. i love the new music spotify finds for me. thank you.,positive
"i like spotify but when i use the app it tells me i have no play lists and all the play lists have nothing on them but when i use spotify on the website i have 2 play lists and there is play lists, why is that?",negative
been using spotify for 6 or 7 years and had all together a year or more of premium. was a great app but now i'm literally getting ads every 2 songs. so i can't recommend it anymore.,negative
"overall, a great application for listening to music 10/10 for that. however the app has some bugs sooo uhhh yeah, i can't even open the app anymore without being stuck on the logo sooo you guys lose points there. 8/10 would recommend.",negative
"i love it on my xbox but the mobile app is poorly formatted and impossible to use, and the limited skips an hour is bs, when you run out you can just change the song manually, and why can't you view the songs on a playlist as a list of individuals like on xbox, the littoral console with a controller being your only way of control, that's right, the xbox version is better formatted than the mobile peice of junk.",negative
best music streaming service ever!!,positive
i love it the best music app thanks,positive
"probably my most used app, i use it every day and have never not used it. full ratings deserved",negative
spotify is a good music app not that many adds and i would really recommend it to my friends.,positive
great way to find and listen to all types of music and get introduced to new artists. but the fact that i can't listen to the song i want to without buying the premium service is extremely annoying. if you want to ask that serves as customizable radio for yourself this is the one for you.,negative
the best app to listen to advertisements,positive
a great experience when you can see the progression of your own music on here flourish you provide a lot for us musicians keep the good work up and fighting for the artists rights and best interest,positive
i like the podcasts and i used to listen to audio books on you tube but i think i'll keep listening to spotify,positive
why are literally all of your ads 3x louder than the songs stop,negative
"why this app getting worse! songs playing and i can't see the player. i can't stop, skip, or do anything. please fix it.",negative
i get to listen to all my favorite bands it's amazing i love it and awesome ðÿ˜ž too i'm a fan of bands so yeah!,positive
"this app is a must but the only thing i don't like it because there's too much of add. after playing one or two music ,there you can hear the sound of the add",negative
"good selection, not so good app.",negative
always great quality. always works great.,positive
spotify is one of the best music apps on this planet! there are absolutely no ads! nothing gets in the way of spotify's music!,positive
"haven't used this app for a very long time and i don't followed any changes, but before i was able to listen one song, i had to watch 8 (!) ads. like 3 x 30 seconds and 5 x 15 seconds ad. the song was shorter than those ads",negative
"best music app ever, i used to spend 100 bucks a month on cds but now 9.99 is all and the best part is that this app finds great new music i would never have found! i love you spotify ""platonic of course""!",positive
"great music app, premium is a must.",positive
"the heart button doesn't work, so i can't add songs to my liked songs",negative
"go to choice for podcasts and music, good app.",positive
"recent update needs urgent bug fix!! control bar missing, music glitches when i turn off phone screen or navigate apps, and sometimes my phone will just start playing randomly now. i don't know what you guys did, but a quick fix would be to just restore an update to last patch. love spotify but can't use (or want to pay for) an app like this....",negative
when i clicked on the songs i wanted to hear it sometimes puts other songs but overall it has all my favorite songs so yeah idk lol i still recommend it to a lot of people,positive
"the app isn't working on my phone anymore (samsung a20). it was working just fine before the more recent update, but now all the playlists are empty and i can't play a single song (and no, i don't have offline mode turned on).",negative
"ot was good until they started musically profiling me using radio wave brainwave frequency mindhacking devices. now, all if the lyrics are different than the artist's and it's nerve wracking..",negative
i couldn't open my spotify account anymore!,negative
you're better off paying for youtube music. there is no way to cancel your account/subscription if you forgot any credentials like a password or user name. have sent them several emails to attempt to cancel since you can't call them but there is no way to cancel because they say they can't find my account but they are charging me for it.,negative
i switched to spotify after google discontinued play music and haven't regretted it.,positive
seems like the random stopping of music has been fixed.thank you! and also people if you can accept what's included on the free spotify aspotify app just upgrade and stop complaining!!,negative
"i love this app. however, recently it's been glitchy. i can't control the songs. the control features are gone. the app stops. please fix soon.",negative
pretty awesome... i get to listen to music and stuff. you have to have premium if you don't wanna listen to ads every other song.,positive
so convenient and easy to use,positive
very nice but innum songs add panuga,negative
continuing to say no internet connection.. with full bars. all other apps working.,negative
i would have given it a 5out of 5 but not bc it don't let me replay a song,negative
spotify app has been kept abruptly freezing and unstable in my one plus 9r device. requesting team to look into the same. it's more guess because of the recent os update by one plus,negative
"great app, although it can be glitchy at times. paying for premiums so worth it.",positive
"what's happened? i've been using spotify for years with no problems. but now podcasts keep randomly pausing, and the control bar has disappeared so i can no longer easily play and pause, or use the sleep function. this app isn't cheap and with this reduced functionality i feel i'm getting a poor deal.",negative
"the worst app i've ever used, ads all the time and a lot of them, six skips an hour plus not being able to play any song you like you have to listen to a whole playlist in a random order with a few songs you were actually looking for, i also constantly run into problems that span across four phones and a laptop so it isn't my device, another limitation is listening on only one device at a time and it takes a little to switch, the only thing i use it for is listening to podcasts which isn't bad",negative
"i always used to like this app and it was my favourite app to listen music or podcasts to, but lately i can't really download anything even though i have plenty of storage left and the app keeps on stopping. i deleted the app multiple times and restarted my phone but nothing works and after the last update everything just got worse.",negative
excellent service with all chromecast devices,positive
"it's ok, but $10/month is too much to pay, especially knowing how little the artists actually get out of that money.",negative
"i will only rate 5 if you include option ""set music as"" ringtone, alarm tone and message alert tone. edit: i'm lowering my rating more because it's annoying that it doesn't have option to remove a certain song directly from my playlist. i still need to get out and find the song to remove it instead of it being available when you click the 3 dots.",negative
"great app, just wish there were cheaper plans bc when your a kid and dont make bank and you want to listen to music...you dont really have the funds to give up 10 dollars a month...i know it doesn't sound like a lot but if you think about it, you not ""getting"" anything, you are enjoying music, and i guess you can just use the default like i do but it is just limiting. the app itself is great and has huge options and good quality, not glitchy and is great!",positive
worst song app because it's have an add in between of songs so worst,negative
"so far so good .... came over from another streaming service and its only the first billing month , i have had no problems and the library is much better, lots more podcast to choose from and .... i dont even miss neil young âœœ",negative
"this is a bad app. resso is much better than spotify. a song is repeated over and over again. i wanted to give it zero star, but there is no system for that. i'm uninstalling it.",negative
all previous comments been covered. started off brilliant under premium plan. now ads coming fast as. i didn't pay to listen to ads & lose playlists etc. i'm canceling subscription.,negative
the app won't even launch on my phone just keeps showing the spotify logo i'm disappointed,negative
very good app but so many ads,positive
spotify is the perfect name....spotty at best. i cant believe how many times the app plays music and sometimes it just doesnt want to. mix that with zero phone support and fix the problem is a joke. i pay for this service for way to long now it just doesnt work at all. ive looked at all forums and nothing has fixed the problem.,negative
"recently i've been having issues with my mobile app, sometimes a song will play but the profile of that song will be a different song, it's laggy. i normally fixed the issue by restarting my phone or updating my spotify app. my most annoying issue though is that i can't even open my mobile app anymore, it just leaves me on the black loading splash screen page with the green logo but never loads. it kinda sucks right now considering i pay for premium. i have a samsung galaxy note 10",negative
"best app to listen to music, unfortunately some of the rarest song & artist that i was looking forward to listen sometime not available ðÿ˜¢",negative
"still buggy but functional. i still see bugs that are really confusing and frustrating. beyond that, it's alright. shuffle doesn't work properly. will improve rating with further bug fixes and shuffle improvement",negative
"i'm having the same issues as some of the last reviews, spotify keeps pausing 3-4 times a song. it's very frustrating and i've starting using another service. hopefully they can get this problem resolved asap.",negative
it's bad it doesn't let you pick your own song. it's so confusing,negative
i spoke with customer service for hours about an issue i was having and the final conclusion was that the issue was with my phone model. if you have issues that are specific to a device you should clearly market it as such if you aren't going to fix it.,negative
one of the best music app,positive
"my go to music app, first started using it years ago because no connection was needed to hear my playlists and i have never strayed.",positive
i find every song every time,positive
damn my profile picture was in my spotify and click man i love the playlist thank you so much,positive
excellent at guessing what kind of music i'd like to hear next. always a great listening experience.,positive
awesome app that stays up to date with the latest rap and hip hop. my favorite app for music by far.....,positive
it is because you don't have the right lyrics for a song,negative
won't show current song playing leaving one to scour the web based on lyrics! so much fun,negative
so bad. ads that will lag your device [s10] and will pop up and start playing random song's at random times. try yt music and audible the programs must be trolling.,negative
i don't want to give money just to listen to a specific song,positive
constant crash and video restarts. instantly connects and plays last video to any bluetooth device you are connected to,negative
doesnt save offline to sd card properly,negative
very good just wish their were less without having to pay,positive
"it's been overall great improvement within couple of years and audio quality is great. the app synchronise between devices perfectly and i love this feature to switch between devices while playing song. i only thing i found weak is song suggestions, though i am using this app from couple of years but still it doesn't recommend or make an auto playlist which i like and groove. please start using better ai so it can suggest and make better playlist for different users.",positive
how do i play a songinstead of a damn playlist..... please.. tell me.... i cant figure out after about an hour,negative
yes it's good cause i like jazz wt all my heart,positive
it won't even load and that's very upsetting considering i was charged for it.,negative
i might as well just totally discontinue usage of this service. i hope they didn't layoff good staff for high school interns.,negative
"as of 7/7, this issue has been resolved. i have changed my review to reflect this change it is normally great, but recently the app has been stopping audio randomly, not letting me pause or fast forward, the pop-up doesn't appear so i can't scroll in the song. i have to close the app to stop the music. while listening to podcasts, the podcast will stop and i will have to start over. due to bugs in the current update, i'm not able to fast forward to where i was.",negative
"great choice of music, easy to create playlist and music always at my fingertips ðÿ’ƒ",positive
i am thoroughly enjoying spotify and the flexibility that i have with this streaming service to create playlist of my favorite types of music.,positive
spotify music player good app,positive
"i've been a long time user of spotify and love the amount and quality of music i can use, but recently it's like i'm paying for nothing. everytime i try to load my downloaded songs i have to close the app a couple times before it will load. i pay to have the ability to listen offline and am not getting that.",negative
i pay for premium and lately its been very aggressive about pausing my music whether im on wifi or data. its been happening to alot of people ive talked to as well. please fix it,negative
spotify plays all of my favorite songs ðÿžµ,positive
"a must app. but payment issues in nepal and can we download the lyrics please. considering these minor things , spotify is great app to listen to music",positive
i gat everything i need right on spotify..,negative
you can find just about any song i don't get ads.,negative
i would give this app five stars if it dinin't have so many ads,negative
new update and a new problem comes up!! now i can't search for my playlists! can't queue properly. uninstalled and reinstalled and it's crashed three times on chromecast in 20 minutes! you guys really are total idiots. and now artists tracks are missing. utterly useless.,negative
really enjoy the music. no technical problems.,positive
i enjoy listening to my music in spotify but it's kind of dumb to listen to your songs and get an ad interruption durning a song other wise i would've rate a 5 but i give you 3 rating it could be better,negative
"improve feature as like if u right swipe the playlist, they gets queued as well, just like songs",negative
"used for a year, and it's better than pandora, however.. missing the most basic feature, play history. this is why i refuse to pay. i use pandora and spotify to discover new music, and when i can't look up who just played, whats the point really? edit: still broken.",negative
love this versatile option for exploring and enjoying my music choices,positive
so many great songs to choose from!!,positive
"you guys should add jpop to the main genres on the menu, just as you've added kpop.",negative
"using this every day, all the time. subscription is worth it.",positive
this app is so hard to navigate on phone if i click a a song a have liked it goes to didn't song i never heard or it might play a demo of the song that is dumb it should play the song,negative
"been a great experience, highly recommend.",positive
great app for finding your favorite music,positive
app doesn't even open! uninstalled it and re downloaded it and nothing still not working !,negative
"use to have beats that then turned in apple music,(which did not like at all) found out about spotify and do not regret getting it.",positive
on my galaxy s22 this app is unreliable at best. podcasts drop off or the app crashes and i can't stop the track and spotify doesn't remember were i was inside of the podcast. it's not usable.,negative
excellent choices in music based on my tastes,positive
"generally good (spotify is a great service). removing a star because their team seems generally unwilling to listen to feedback from the user community. just go look at their help forums for tons of examples where an issue is reported, backed up by hundreds of users, but no indication they will work on it. please fix the shuffle algorithm! i have a 40 hour playlist but end up hearing the same songs every day.",negative
"endless issues, stops and/or starts without any reason, plays episodes i didn't request. frequently stops and won't play at all. it's the worst of all the podcast players i use - i only use it because i can't get rogan anywhere else. if it wasn't for joe rogan and the dark horse podcast, i'd dump it in a heartbeat and never miss it.",negative
i love the spotify app. especially the lyrics feature...i can sing along!,positive
love it!!! great work out tool also.,positive
definitely a good app for music or podcasts. the premium subscription thing is probably a bit overpriced though.,negative
"nothing. after i registered and pay premium mini i can't play or add, open profile of my account. how it this even possible? plus daily mox from spotify aslo marked as empty",negative
i love that i can listen to my downloaded music without using my data.,positive
i enjoy spotify.every song i want it right here,positive
"love it especially every favorite song i play, especially since i'm a huge music head.",positive
ui needs work (by that i mean just a simple feature to be added as to swipe down on the mini player and that ends the song )so far so good tho,positive
"very spotty servers, laggy mobile and desktop apps that crash and hang with no explaination despite top tier hardware. catalog shrinking due to political and copywrite nonsense.",negative
this is the worst podcast player. everything is harder than it should be.,negative
i loved when i downloaded it but after like one week it's forcing to buy the premium version. i can't even play i single song without buying it. it's really annoying! i loved this app & keep wanted to use it but...,negative
i don't understand why spotify needs my mic in order to work. otherwise i have no trouble with the app.,negative
it was a ok app didn't have it that long was use to pandora music playing guess i will try it again some day,negative
"best streaming music and podcast app. especially if you like discovering new music, this app is for you.",positive
"didn't think i would enjoy spotify, i couldn't have been more wrong. dr",negative
it's the best music app to listen to your favorites songs,positive
everything works and sounds great.,positive
good stuff on spotify,positive
it takes so long just to download,negative
ok so here's the deal spotify has this new update where they add there recommended songs on there...this is a problem because you come to spotify yo listen to your playlist and the music you like now all you here on your playlist is songs you don't know and can't sing along to...the only way to get rid of it is by adding at least 15 songs to your playlist! so me being like ok i did so...for awhile everything was good but the spotify kept playing songs that i didn't add! useless!!!,negative
this app is good but pls make an update where i can delete recent played pls plss i beg you,negative
"long time user. lately it's been full of glitches. can't control the app, it always says spotify is trying to play, it randomly pauses whatever you're listening to every few minutes. it's almost unusable right now. its a shame because it's been my go to for so long ðÿ˜•",negative
i love this app but when i try to listen to my fav song it puts something else that's why i am giving you 1 star make it ok please,positive
love spotify i recemend it to all my friends absolutely love the blend play list,positive
i just wish for better sound quality and a light mode option,negative
i pay for spotify premium now because i don't like ads but amazon music was absolutely atrocious when it came to podcasts. i have had zero issues with spotify at anytime for anything!,negative
easy to use enyable and entertainable,positive
"it works only when you open it, it's getting hard to use.",negative
"30 mins 1-2 ads (pc), 10 mins 3 ads (android/ios)",negative
every time i wanna play a song. it plays the wrong song that i dont like. please fix this,negative
my favourite app. the perfect one. love you spotify ðÿ’œ,positive
a huge collection of music,positive
"amazing for music. glitchy and extremely unreliable for podcasts. please fix it asap, premium doesn't feel very premium anymore. edit: one year later and the issue remains. 2 star becomes 1 star.",negative
i've used spotify for years and have payed for premium for a few years now. recently the app has started skipping and cutting the music like a broken record. the problem stops when my phone screen is either unlocked or at least on. i've tried all of the recommended fixes online. none of them have worked. if the problem persists i will be canceling my premium subscription.,negative
"does whatever it wants, it's easily the worst of the apps similar to it. it turns podcasts on or off at will and changes the podcast mid episode and loses its place which can be annoying to go back and track down where you left off. all this especially since 99% of the time i'm using the app while driving. not a fan but i got a prompt to review the app so here it is.",negative
"very interesting! great format , real lovely",positive
ever time i try to listen to a certain song it always play something different.,positive
very good selection of music,positive
wonderful songs apps,positive
spotify has introduced me to so much great music based on what i already listen to. every music lover should have this app!,positive
"after few minues of installing the app, and after i opened it, i was surprised by the ammount of restrictions that you add to the app, to a level that you maked it dead. it is like someone is in a prison or detention. i hate how you put the users in this situation to pay premium which is not accepted. although, if you would like to make the app better, at least show how it is cool and useful for at least the first few days, then i might think if maybe i would like to purchase the premium.",negative
just awesome and easy,positive
the fact that the sometimes you can't end group session and needing to reinstall it every time is cancer. because of that sometimes the reinstalled app can't open. you can't even do a damn group session on the desktop like bro it's 2022 how badly advance do you want it to be.,negative
i love it!!! very useful and worth it u should try,positive
"love the app, but somehow now it doesn't show me audio controls for podcasts. meaning i can't pause, skip, go back, or whatever. :/",negative
"i got spotify premium but why can't i click the shuffle button multiple times, now it just starts nd pauses the song. plz fix its annoying",negative
"best music app but it has flaws, im on android and if i plug in my headphones spotify automatically starts playing without me goig into the app. another flaw is that its gonna play ads every 30 mins but its more like every 10 minutes. great app overall tho",negative
spotify podcast suck so much a**. the absolute only reason i use it is to occasionally listen to rogan... unfortunately it barely works. spotify should gtfo of podcast because they can't even make a reliable podcast player... pos.,negative
"my playlists are not on spotify mobile so i can't do anything on it. linked account on laptop, etc work fine. only mobile. 1 star.",negative
too many advertisements. had to listen to 10 advertisements in a row before finally listening to some music,negative
"play bar disappears and you cannot skip or pause playing episode, only way it comes back is with a force close.",positive
love using this podcast,positive
"you guys are making this app worst day by day. you need to understand what the users demand. just don't think about your so called business. for example, today i was playing my liked song and it jumped into another playlist. and now i can't even change the song or playlist. what the heck is this?",negative
spotify premium is great app to play all your fav music!,positive
why you added that hiding feature? because it sucks when i want to unhide any song!,negative
fantastic app bc it so cool an easy to use,positive
well worth it for an infinity of songs and especially because there aren't any lame whining canadian neil young songs...ðÿ¤£,positive
"love this app, however there is a bug where the player is not showing and its becoming really annoying.",negative
my music keeps stopping for no reason. the web player for computers is way better than the app.,negative
you have to buy premium for the app to work correctly,negative
downloaded episodes don't play without internet. what's the point,positive
best music player in the world love you spotify ðÿ’—ðÿ’—ðÿ’—ðÿ’—ðÿ’—ðÿ’—ðÿ’—ðÿ’—ðÿ’—ðÿ’—ðÿ’—ðÿ’—ðÿ’—ðÿ’—ðÿ’—ðÿ’—,positive
wowwwwwww one of the best audio play music platform i love it. awesome.,positive
"moved to deezer after constant skipping of tracks or restarting then , plus random shut down ..just because you are the largest streaming company does not mean you can provide a substandard app to your paying customer's, i would advise not starting a payment subscription right now as these issues have been going on for months , my subscription is now cancelled and i've moved to deezer which is a far superior streaming service .",negative
"i can't give this 5 stars because they took one of my absolute favorites (planet net, by the subdigitals) off here completelyðÿ˜”. but i'll give 4 for everything else",positive
"great app for playing music, although when i search up a song i want to play, after all the adverts have played, i have to skip through multiple different songs and sometimes i don't have enough skips to get to the song i want so most of the time i go on yt and play it because i can't be bothered waiting for songs i don't know to finish playing!",positive
"i would have rated it 5 but the lyrics in songs are in tht(ex.korean,telugu) language only i mean english too and i took subcription of a week and it just wont let me see the download optionðÿ˜“",positive
amazing app nd whatever song u searchðÿ”... u r gonna find it.... it's so flexible to use nd really good audioðÿ”š quality ðÿ¥°,positive
"these new updates suck are you going to fix the offline mode, because when i dont have data i want to open my downloaded playlist, an all i get is a black screen, i shouldnt need more data to play something that is already downloaded. for now im going to cancel my suscription, i dont want to live with this again, ill try youtube music",negative
"has been bugging out recently. won't show what i'm playing, will randomly stop, isn't keeping track of playlists",negative
it's pretty cool i like it but too much ads and lyrics in songs are wrong but still i like it,positive
when i try to watch a podcast using spotify on my t.v it won't show me the image,negative
"echoing the feedback from other premium users - the app was working perfectly fine until a few months ago. now podcasts and music pause without obvious reasons, and some of the buttons disappear randomly. it's really frustrating.",negative
"covid spam, crashing, hard to navigate. takes forever to load list of episodes. no fast forward. buy premium to skip song lol.",negative
this is best app because all songs are available on it and also my favourite kaira l love *spotify* thank you *spotify*for this you are amazing,positive
the hell is wrong with spotify. it always play the wrong music,negative
why can't i use the app for a few days now? i tried uninstalling installing. even rebooting my phone and yet nothing happens. i need to stream.,negative
"the user interface needs to be a little more usable when it comes to reporting songs with swear words in as some are missed. also, they do not include certain swear words into the explicit category so i will often hear s*** in songs and no e next to them.",negative
best music app so far,positive
"hi, i changed my account to 2 accounts, the monthly fee went up but the changes didn't happen, when you don't do your job properly, how do you expect to receive the fee?",negative
this is a amazing app and i feel that it has all of the songs i ever want to play and i am glad i downloaded it.,positive
brilliant music experience.,positive
"i really don't understand how one of the biggest music apps on the planet can be this buggy. frequently missing the ""now playing"" tab at the bottom of the app, which means all controls (skip, pause, etc) are missing. randomly says ""no internet connection"" while clearly connected to the internet and streaming. if you search for a song and play it, then let it autoplay similar songs afterwards, you can't go back and listen to the original song without backing out and selecting the song again.",negative
it's not opening. the app isn't opening,negative
best platform for streaming music tbh,positive
there is some bug that does not allow the songs to be played in the order it shows in the playlist. please fix this,negative
i have premium but it still wont let me download songs for some reason,positive
"absolutly love it! my husband and i both have lists,that people follow. .trippylist is one of them.. if you like phish, dave matthews, widespread panic, follow trippylist. abd tgeres other vands on it",positive
"nice app it's handy and most music is on it, you guys should add music soul mate.",positive
good but please add an option to rearrange songs in our playlist again. don't wanna open my pc and google chrome again and again just to do it.,negative
app will not load just flashing spotify symbol and no customer support to fix it. i've had it since google music stopped 2 years ago. i've loved spotify since but for the past week the app won't load. i've uninstalled and installed 90 times but still won't load. spotify needs custom service and support. you don't value our money or membership if you can't provide that much,negative

it's really nice as you can make your own playlists but it doesn't show songs by its self. you need to search them and then add them all one by one.,negative
"*update* still no response re my emails. so disappointed. time to cancel services i think. the status band from the bottom of the screen is gone. i can't pause, skip forward or back etc and it makes navigating the app frustratingly difficult. i have emailed a help request twice now with no response. i've uninstalled and reinstalled. i've logged out and back in. still nothing. for an app i pay a premium price for i would think somebody would interested in resolving the issue.",negative
easy to navigate app with all your fav tunes,positive
never needed to look anywhere else for a specific song.,positive
hlo sir i am spotify user sir i request your premium plan on payment method in play store i requested you pls open the service in play store payment pls i humble request,negative
"spotify has become smoother since my last review, so i have to clear the app out of history a lot less. i'm not a big fan of the new plus button in the bottom right corner. i don't need to make a new playlist so often that a dedicated spot in the menu is necessary and i don't make podcasts at all. this button is functionally pointless for me and moved the other buttons that i used slightly to the left. overall, still a great app. i'm just nitpicking the constant changes to the ui.",negative
constant problems with this app for 2 straight years. all that money and can't put out a good app that simply works...,negative
great music. easy to navigate.,positive

"first of all i have it for like 1year now and it super works but rights now it didn't let me in i tried to uninstall it but it still didn't, pls fix this",negative
"since you've updated this app, it no longer connects to the dedicated spotify app on my pioneer head unit, only through the phones bluetooth. this has been proven by people uninstalling and reinstalling an older version though an apk install. please fix. zero interest from spotify brings this down to one star due to lack of any customer service.",negative
there is no option to download single song. download is available for full album only. so add icon to download one by one song.,negative
"i love it.... i will recommed this app for everyone to useâ™¡ i loved the most is that it shows lyrics in every single song and it it has a really few adds, you all guys know how irritating the adds areðÿ˜¢but you will not face that problem in spotifyðÿ‘ðÿ‘ðÿ‘i loved your application.",positive
after using spotify premium for 3 months it's nice but if you don't pay for it you will have a hell of a time doing anything on the app.,negative
"do not buy premium. you still get ads for podcasts. it is not the podcasts' ads, they are supplemental ads that go straight to spotify. on top of that, they have overoptimized this just like every other app. convenient to switch from car play to non car play, only problem is the floating button is placed right over the play button for a song or album. these overlooked problems are everywhere. buttons on top of buttons, settings not saving, network not updating. i cant justify $9.99/month anymore",negative
"spotify is a nice app and i like it very much but all of a sudden the songs in my playlist aren't visible and there are only names of the songs. i can't order the songs in the way that i want and i can't see what song is next. i deleted spotify and installed it again but it didn't work, i also cleared chache but that still did nothing.",negative
"i have to uninstall and reinstall this app every few days. podcasts just randomly stop playing, even if i've downloaded them. annoying.",negative
it always tells me i am offline. i know i'm not because all my other apps work fine.,negative

awful app and service. no longer paying for premium as spotify simply does not work!,negative
excellent. enjoying spotify on phone & in car very much!,positive
"terrible really. slow to load menus, searches, library. sometimes it wont even load my saved songs for minutes forcing me to restart the app. even worse if it's in offline mode. often just stops playing randomly and has to be reset to work again. terrible app",negative
whenever i randomly open the app (randomly) it just keeps stopping and i don't know why tap on a podcast another song starts playing.... it's not that my phone lags or something else but no my phone is brand new and about about my connection then i really have a very strong connection.... i uninstalled and reinstalled it but still same problem. it was making me sick.... i really hope that the developers see this issue and fix it..,negative

great content! drops out sometimes or turns off for unknown reason.. but great free app!,positive
bad. for some strange reason my app is not working. i switched to premium and now the app just starts and shuts. don't know if this issue is connected with my mobile or otherwise. looking forward to hear from the technical team of spotify thanks..,negative

i'm a premium user and can say this app is so buggy it's insane while listening to podcasts they constantly restart and i have to try and figure out where i left off because when it does restart it also marks the entire podcast as played so you have no clue where you left off on top of that since the new update i can't access what is actually playing on the app at all it doesn't even say i'm listening to anything and i'm unable to pause unless i close the app fix it i'm sick of paying for broken,negative

"navigating podcasts is such a hassle. you scroll down a podcast, find a podcast and add it to your playlist. then it goes right to the top. so you have to scroll down again.",negative
the amount of ads after listening to 15 minutes of music is getting frustrating. i'm a free user but i feel like i'm bombarded with ads.,negative

"love it! â¤ i can find all of my music, podcasts, meditations in one place.",positive
the whole package is great. i would recommend this app to everyone,positive
"why did the shuffle option change when you listen one of your playlists ? it just sucks, the same songs play on repeat and you juste have to skip them multiple times when you could just skip them once before, and just go on with your 45h of songs. also the linked songs in the radio are the same that are already in my playlists, yeah i like them but what i wanted was discover new ones... and if you want to remove them from radio because you already know them it just delete them from your playlist",negative

the problem is that i'm trying to listen to my music but on phone there is no way to stop the randomized song option which chooses from your playlist which doesn't sad to bad until you notice that they also added songs so play instead of your music and i've spent an hour deleting music off my play list that i didn't even add and after i finished they added more songs so basically what i'm saying is is that i can't even listen to the songs i like when using this app,negative

"the music available is awesome,i have no need or desire to listen to the podcast selection. if i could find another alternative to this(spotify), without the annoying podcast,i'd do it in a heartbeat.",positive
it is the best music app i ever had.,positive
y'all can find almost every song/mashup/remixes here!!,negative
why cant i get a premium? it has been 6 months since i got a premium but why cant i get now? is this a bug or malfunction?,negative
"very limited on commercials, straight to the good music..",negative
i enjoy listening to my christian favorite songs,positive
excellent application more than the others.,positive
your better off listening to music on youtube because then at least you may actually be able to pick what song you want to play on a playlist instead of it forceing it to being random every time and sometimes it'll play stuff that's not even on your playlist and the only way to skip it is to have premium or use one of your six skips for the day. the only reason i'm keeping it is to keep track of which songs i actually like so that way i can listen to them on youtube. would not use again,negative
amazing music app,positive
best music streaming app,positive
"pc version which i used on a tablet was absolutely amazing but the mobile version is dogshit, can't even pick a specific song to play and i can only skip 6 times? retared system which makes me want to drink bleach.",negative
spotify is the best app that i used the songs are amazing,positive
the ads are ridiculous!!! i'm a free listener and every two songs there is 5 commercials and it's dumb so i am going to stop using this app!!!!!!!!!,negative
it's easy to use and also user friendly,positive
"should section off playlist we created from added playlists. it constantly disconnect me from facebook and my friends isn't visible or updated. even when my friends are visible, what they are playing isn't updated. the songs that isn't english, example japanese or chinese have reduced significantly.. even english ones are no exception.",negative
i love it. all i can say is. it has all i needed to hear. â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸,positive
"would rate better if i could choose the songs i'd actually want to listen to, the xbox/tablet/web client are all far better than this junk.",negative
"i don't know if this is a glitch, but i can't even choose the song i want to play when i want to listen to my playlist. it just plays some random song. i tried to play lofi music to relax and it played we don't talk about bruno. its kinda annoying that i have a small chance it'll actually play the song i want. i'm still gonna keep trying though. i also keep getting ads for period pads which is kinda gross ðÿ¤¨",negative
my spotify took too long to open. i tried clearing the data and cache but it still doesn't work and operate. pls help fix this.,negative
stopps playing for no apparent reason. no more dropdown comands. its still buggy which is kind off incredible for such a big company. shame,positive
"if you want to discover new music than this app is for you. because it will add to your playlists, it does not give a choice in the matter. i understand what they were meaning when they did this but it can get annoying. if they fixed this i would like it more.",negative
it's awesome having all the songs you can think of in 1 spot and the lyrics playing along is the best feature. love it,positive
i ain't gonna buy premium try putting as much as advertisements u want!,negative

it is a wonderful app. it has all. kind of songs and can be operated on both pc and mobiles.,positive
"this app is easily the best music streaming app when you pay for premium. no ads, offline downloads, great recommendations, unbelievably high audio quality, and a very user friendly ui. without premium, you have relentless ads, lesser audio quality, no offline downloads, you're not allowed to ever turn off shuffle play. i get most of these, but when you lock playing albums in order behind a paywall, i think you're getting a little money hungry. just pay premium and you'll get your money's worth",positive
fun fun fun!,positive
i just really like for the music,positive
it's bad in the sense because it provide all benefits just in the paid version. i mean to say some benefits also provide to the free version.,negative

"when o open it, it just stuck on the logo.",negative
"you should be glad i rated this 2 stars. why? because i made a playlist and random songs keep playing, i literally have like 10+ songs in my playlist and i didn't hear any of them, please..fix it. also when i listen to songs they just randomly stop, kindly fix yhe bugs^^ thanks",negative
did really like this app but for 4 or 5 days the app gets permanently stuck after repeatedly playing the same add (clash podcast) has made a great app unusable - will revise stars if/when issue fixed,negative
"not reliable enough to pay for. if you're willing to put up with crashes and times where it just won't open, fine. just don't pay for it expecting the paid subscription to change anything; it doesn't.",negative
inappropriate and irrelevant advertising that isn't kid friendly.,negative

keeps putting a push in my notification area even though i blocked notifications. uninstalled. play music is much better anyway.,negative
"app takes forever to load...like over 1 min. program is very slow to start playing, but works after. don't know if it is because it is downloading songs or if it is a memory hog. i have my songs on an sd card.",negative
exploring n awesome experience,positive
just awesome app for music lovers,positive
"i overall enjoy spotify because i can download with premium. sadly i can't play it on my phone right now because my phone updated and spotify just has empty playlists and nothing works. it says i'm not connected to the internet and i am. i have done everything imaginable including deleting it, logging out, etc and nothing is worked to fix it. i don't know if this is the phone update issue or spotify hasn't caught up to the updates yet.",negative
"spotify has been extremely buggy on my samsung s22+. the biggest problem is when i open spotify, whatever was last playing or is currently playing is not displayed in the player. it's just missing. closing and reopening spotify used to fix that. lately it will persist through attempts to fix it. has a lot of problems accessing ""offline"" content i specifically downloaded to listen to when offline. displaying wrong dates shows were last updated ðÿ˜• fix this buggy app!",negative

they would add their songs to my playlist! i can't make a playlist without having songs i didn't put on it on.,negative
"everything i'm looking for, an app worth listening to.",negative
well i love this app the platform is so accessible and easy but mainly if you have spotify premium like if you don't have it you usually have to play an ad or a couple to play 1 song or it plays a song in the same genre. but with premium you can download songs for when your offline and no ads! it's amazing if you have premium,positive
it was a great app except now it cuts in and out sometimes for some reason. sometimes it won't even play. please fix this,negative
if used properly. a great app to share with your family and friends,positive

we couldn't even download any music for free,negative
"linkable to many services and devices. selections somewhat diverse. convenient w/ offline dl's (paid)ã€šbutã€‹poor shuffle randomizer. wasteful efforts on useless features, ie: strange things mode. i mean really? a feature only experienced on a single page? i mean, who watches the screen while listening? even mtv learned that years ago. but the penultimate reason i can't give above 3 is they don't pay artist's a fair share of the profits. so much so that many musicians boycott spotify.",negative
way better than apple music or amazon music,positive
it wouldn't go past the loading screen even after trying to restart my device and uninstalling and reinstalling the app.,negative
the play and pause button are not coming on.,negative
not displaying current song being played. can't use on multiple devices at the same time.,negative

"having an issue where the app hides the ability to skip, pause and so on.",negative
easy to use but sound quality is so so,positive
100% has everything!,positive
the app is great. but i don't like how the playlist has to be shuffled. what if i want to listen to a particular song? i can only skip 6 times an hour. i really dislike that.,negative
when you pick a song it doesn't play it but the next playlist please fix,negative
sometimes my spotify plays random music not in ny playlist,negative
constantly crashes. won't resume the podcast i was listening to. instead starts a random episode. almost impossible to use.,negative

"worked perfectly until i started paying this app worked perfectly for years until i decided to try the free trail. now my control bar has disappeared, my played podcasts are coming up as unplayed, i've lost podcasts i was subscribed to. i won't be renewing my subscription if the premium doesn't even work",negative
app sucks and non functional. monthly payments for this bs! if i'm paying money for something it should always be functional and bug free,negative
really enjoyed the free trial. got my son to uograde his account to a premium family account,positive
i've used spotify off and on for quite some time and i like it but if i had to say one thing negative i would say turn the volume down on your ads and that's it!,negative

i can't even use the app. it loads up just the symbol then sits there and goes no where idk what the problem is and none of the trouble shooting tactics are working. i've payed for premium so shouldn't i get to use the f-ing app. i would do 0 outta 5 if i could.,negative
app won't reflect my playlists. has been updated. won't let me update my screen name either. no available support for these issues either. remind me why i pay for premium again?!,negative
updated: the recent android version is very buggy. random pausing and display errors with the player not showing so you can't interact with the song requiring a hard close/open. seems to be a common new complaint,negative
"#jre is truly the only reason i use spotify. pretty good, you can find and listen to almost anything. ads stink, especially the ads from spotify trying to get me to pay for premium so i don't have to listen to ads.",negative
it's a good music app but i wish the student discounts applied to high schoolers not just college.,positive

stop showing these bts ads in background,negative
absolutely love this app. i have a very interesting fan light that has a bluetooth and have paired my phone and able to pick out any song with guest and sing and dance with this ceiling fan that changes colors and has a speaker. using spotify puts so many genres at your fingertips to keep the party rocking!!!,positive
"i paid last month for premium family & my wife. unfortunately she past away two weeks ago. love the music, but i'll keep her phone too for when family come 5o visit.",negative
i haven't had any problems with this app. i have been using it for a long time. i would just like to suggest that there should be an option to select a few songs at once to add to a playlist. sometimes it is a bit frustrating to choose songs individually.,negative
if there is a way to sort downloaded songs by artist that would catch you guys up with 15 year old music players. also can you manage to show album art properly for a whole week straight? and the now playing bar doesn't always show up now and whatever is causing that also keeps me from controller music with my car or earbuds. just don't be trash for 3 months straight. dare ya,negative
handy in the car or in the shower for whatever music i'm feeling or cool podcast i want to discover. can't imagine having to make do without it.,negative
"been away for a bit, app got worse! i seriously don't get how this can happen. every time i open the app i get stuck in the ad loops! like seriously how many ads do i have to listen to. i have to close the app and reopen it. talk about making it so u subscribe. i'll definitely be finding another app. horrible!",negative
songs stop playing randomly and over the last two days the player bar disappeared so i can't pause / skip / etc. i have to force close the app to make playback stop. works again after i restarted phone.,negative
"cyber beggers, begging for premium subscription in between every songs.",negative
i now can't pause music or podcasts. i don't know if there has been recent update but this has been happening since yesterday. i uninstalled the app yesterday then reinstalled this morning. iwas working fine until now. won't use app again. this is a pain in the neck.,negative
"was fine until like 6-9 months ago. music player keeps disappearing, so i can't pause or skip through tracks correctly. this sometimes causes the music to stop randomly as well. really frustrating. using samsung s10e",negative
it would be really nice if spotify could bring out the feature of using upi for the subscriptions for premium like netflix. this would really help people like me who wanna take out a subscription but don't have a visa card. please do consider in the near future!,negative
"good music app! sure, the spotify premium only features are annoying, but it gives me music. it's functional, unlike pandora. â­â­â­â­â­",positive
it reduces my storage to be fully songs that i can make a playlist n play it online ðÿ’¯,negative
i love spotify i use it all the time it bring so much joy into my life,positive

great variety of music!,positive
"really good to use, i've been using spotify a lot in the last 2â½ years, haven't had any issues with it (besides losing signal every now and then when in the car - as a passenger)",negative
"keeps pausing on it's own every couple of seconds for no god damn reason. if i could just scroll from the top of my screen and press the play button i wouldn't mind, but i have to enter the app again to press play just for it to pause again.",negative
awesome app but too many adds ðÿ˜’,negative
"works fine on mobile, if i'm on wifi no matter which one it just won't load anything, i tried everything, the app has all permissions, still nothing!",negative
overall it is good but the only problem is that the ads. they just take to long for it to play the next song you want to play like 3-4 ads will happen in between of you listening to what you want to listen.,negative
"won't let me play songs i want, and also shuffles songs when i want a specific song also also it ""adds music i might like"" i hate it, why cant i have just a few songs that i want",positive
"the service itself is great but the mobile app is infintely annoying. most frequently i just listen to my ""liked songs"" playlist. i choose a song to listen to in the car then close the app when i get out. anyone with a brain would think i'd want to continue listening from where i left off, right? so why is it that when i reopen the app, even if it's only been closed for a minute, my playlist has jumped ahead by about 100 songs? this is incredibly irritating. i would give 5 stars if not for this.",negative
amazing app for those who love music ðÿž¶.... but sometimes there will be some glitches... but not all the time ðÿ˜‰... if u r reading reviews to download this app then just go and download this application â˜ºï¸ðÿ‘.,positive
best place to listen to music too!!,positive
good content for podcast.,positive
"3 stars until i see an update to fix this issue. i love this app, i've been a paid subscriber for years, but for the love of god if i have ""unedited"" songs in my liked songs, do not! switch them out for edited versions!...i'm 30 years old and if i wanted to hear the edited version of ""gin and juice"" i probably wouldn't be listening to r & b in the first place, please fix this has happened to me so many times!",negative
excellent ðÿ‘œ... good for burning calories....,positive
i can't turn off shuffle i don't have the icon,negative
i've had spotify for about 5 years now and i'm a premium user i love the sound quality and the music they put on here the only problem which is why i'm give 4 stars is that it keeps glitching when i'm skipping songs it will either not play or keep going to the song previous or just skip 3 songs over other then that great app,negative
app is amazing but after the recent update i'm unable to login to my profile. app won't open it gets stuck at the launch doesn't show any fields for email address and password. hope they fix the bug asap,negative
this app is worth its keep. have enjoyed it so far. hope they can improve on the sound output.,positive
"it's fun and free, but because of the auto shuffle i can't listen to a single song, even recommended songs i have to wait and listen to 5 other songs just to listen to a song i might not even like.",negative
very useful and enjoyable app.,positive
"i was once a deezer user but when i tried this app, i have been so addicted to music",negative
"spotify is great, i love it",positive
"worked fantastic on mobile until recent update. it will take a short time to load (usually seamless), but then the controls do not appear after selecting a song. don't know if that has to do with an ad that always plays? can't see which one, no controls or album/ad view. after a few songs it will cut off. this time it crashed after 2 songs. addendum: same issue with podcasts, even if an advert doesn't play first--no controls, cuts off unexpectedly. happens on wifi or cell data",negative
"hey, can you give us an option to just randomly play a song, either from any of the playlists or from your suggestions for me or any random song and not just the last played song, from the home page upon app load? more like the surprise me option in netflix?",negative
very good music app,positive
brilliant especially on bluetooth,positive
"the app is pretty ok but the newish design changes are annoying and intrusive. i just want all my playlists in one place which doesn't need me to add filters or whatever. adding and removing songs is a chore and in general there seems to be a tendency to adding unnecessary and ugly buttons everywhere. also, why is the basic menu laggy? do we need wifi constantly to just pull up the tab to add or remove from playlist. the recommendations and compilation albums etc are very good though.",negative
best music experience ever,positive
it adds songs that i don't want hear!,positive
"i can't use my spotify, i don't know what happened.",negative
any options left for students who cannot afford premium and have to deal with double unskippable ads?,negative
perfect music app!,positive
"usually love spotify, but recently been having problems with it! after about 15 minutes of playing something it just cuts off, radio silence. when opening app, it takes a long time to respond, doesn't show you what you were listening to so end up having to find episode/song and play from beginning. the other day the whole app just wouldn't open at all?? something has happened in the recent updates that has made it really buggy and laggy.",negative
good music so many ads,positive

some songs are unplayableðÿ˜’ please introduce the light theme alsoðÿ™‚,positive
"i used to love it because i could play my favorite tracks anytime. the ads were annoying yet bearable. however, recently, i haven't been able to even open the app. whenever i try to open spotify, it just kicks me out. currently i'm using an alternative. i might leave a better review next time if this is fixed.",negative
when i share it in snapchat the thumbnail appears twice and the link appears only once with the image i can't delete that so please fix this problem asap,negative

why did you remove the thing where you can listen to the music a bit before putting on your playlist,negative
"completely different from the web version, good sound quality yet any playlist song is completely random and you have 6 daily skips, can't get around it by playing single songs too. overall the app is o.k. but the pc/computer web version is way better than the app.",positive
"app crashes constantly, the media bar disappears when playing music or podcasts and then i can't pause things, and the sound will randomly turn itself down while listing to music (not related to another notification appearing on the phone). this app is trash",negative
it's a super cool app you will get all songs you want tho it has add but still working amazingly well when you have low range,positive
"recently had started stopping randomly when screen is locked. also the play bar at the bottom disappears a lot of the time so the only way for me to stop a song is to shut down the entire app and start again. lots of glitches, not great.",negative
i totaly recommend you best music app ever its really worth it ðÿ˜šðÿ˜šðÿ˜šðÿ˜šðÿ˜š,positive
love this app it makes me feel better when se thing happened.,positive
i don't have any issues with this app at all really amazing,negative
good if you have premium without it it's kinda trash,negative
"the app runs like a**. every time i reopen it when i want to resume a podcast or song, der player disappears and the pages load for a minute or more. every other app on my phone works fine.",negative
i would say it was great 1yr ago but now it is the equivalent to apple music,negative
! it would be nice if one could sort the songs in one's own playlist manuel or after genres. -sometimes i have the feeling that the app is a little bit buggy or weird because sometimes it doesn't let me put songs in repeat. +but all in one it's a nice app.,positive
this is very good aap . i like this aap very much . there all type of songs . thanku so much for this aap .,positive
you need to fix this i can't choose my own music and i have family premium... fix this please,positive
good sound quality â¤ï¸â¤ï¸,positive
app works great!!!!,positive
great app and spotify is the best,positive
"best app as it , provides a wide range of songs , bgms and also supported background music , but it will be better if we can clip from these songs and listen those clips",positive
playlists are the same song you already have...... in a playlist.,negative
podcast video disappears randomly and doesn't show up even after force stopping the app. terrible ui and i'm using android,negative
this is amazing. i really like itðÿ’œðÿ’œ #spotifyðÿ’œðÿ’œ,positive
spotify needs some help after using for a few weeks it previewed only i mean the song stops after 10 secs i tried really hard ðÿ˜… but it was broken,negative
"i keep wanting to use this app for podcast and everytime i get discouraged. this time, i'm listening to podcast fine but i cannot pause it at all. the control to see what i'm playing is not there. only way to stop it is to force stop it. i'll try again at some point but it's pretty unusable for me. also, the controls don't translate to my car when i connect over bluetooth. i'll update when these aren't issues.",negative
"i love spotify, especially how it suggests other songs when i'm editing a playlist.",positive
"why won't it let me in? it's been like this for two days, fix it.",negative
"would not open no matter what i tried, spent about 2 hours trying to fix it. :( it was pretty good when it did work.",negative
"it sure has improved a lot compared to the earlier days, however i would love to see a better pricing policy for me to opt in and avoid the adds.",positive
"compared to the desktop app, this app is terrible. bugs everywhere, too many extra ""features"" being added while the core functionality gets worse. for example regularly the play/stop buttons just simply disappear. only way to stop the audio is forcing closing the app. this doesn't happen on other audio apps. ""offline mode"" doesn't work, you could download something and get on a plane and the file won't play.",negative
you can find amazing songs!you can find ur favourite artist,positive
"please fix the dozens of bugs. shocking experience. now playing bar doesn't appear, podcasts won't play despite being fine on desktop. had to uninstall and redownload, lost all my downloaded songs and files. i live in a bad signal area so rely on downloads when not on wifi. for a market leader it's absolutely ridiculous.",negative
"pretty good, like the recommendations but now my playlists are buried under other stuff unless i click for only my composed playlists. i do love some of the suggestions made by spotify.",negative
"i searched for a song appeared, when playing it not the song i've searched ðÿ‘žðÿ‘žðÿ‘ž",negative
it has all the good music i like,positive
i love spotify!!,positive
everything is good i really like this app but there's one thing why isn't canvas available in nepal ?? please make sure canvas is available in nepal too.,positive
i really love this app i literally use it everyday and have a subscription however. for some reason it stops playing all the time it will be playing fine for 20 mins then all the sudden it stops playing and when i try to press play it won't so i have to close the app completely and go back just to turn it back on.,negative
wonderful app! you can play music offline even without premium. the only problem is that there are too many ads.,positive
great songs from this app.,positive
i know a lot of apps do this now. but spotify happens to be the one that did it recently. it's really really annoying to have my phone go off every single day when spotify failed to get payment.,negative
had no probs for so many years in my android phone but now idk why but my spotify doesn't lauch its always hanged on a black screen.,negative
"i have been experiencing a sudden stop to what am i listening. several times in the same podcast for example. also, lately there is an error and i can't see anymore the buttons. i was listening to a playlist, had the music stopped not by me, and had to go back to the same music manually. or i didn't had the skip the music even visible on my screen.",negative
"i love it! would give it 5 stars, but i have to undownload it once and a while because the app wont show the song i am listening too.",negative
"excellent app. love the music variety to listen to. not having app issues.ðÿ‘ðÿ‘ðÿ‘ *(edit) this last update is bad, i need to hear 3 ads before i get a chance to hear a random song, yeah you heard it right (a random song) because it doesn't let me listen the one i want, if i am lucky i can listen to that song after 6 skips. it shuffles the songs. total stars goes down to 2 ðÿœÿ.*",negative
"good appp for music listeners. however, please stop adding other kinds of music in my playlist. it's not a good option...",negative
awesome great for downloading tracks and albums would totally recommend for all ages. just think it uses too much space. recently it has been occasionally crashing or stopping music. but other then that its a great app.,positive
app is not opening.. i have installed it several times still the issue isn't fixed..,negative
got some bugs going on. had to uninstall cuz the app went into possessed mode.... i was watching a movie when out of no where music started interrupting...,negative
i love spotify!,positive
"app frequently clears my queue with no warning, repeats the same song 10+ times, breaks my playlists",negative
love spotify soo much i love music so that makes sense but i can't afford to have premium so if u want to play whatever song u want without worrying about your skips have spotify on a tablet or i pad and u can just pick what song u want out of your play list if that makes sense,negative
"songs clarity superb, good app to hear all journals of music.",positive
"urgent requirement! âš ï¸ you must add the ""download music option"" in tha application. although downloads remain close inside the application. but it should me in free mode.",negative
"it is cool and good songs are there,no ads and no advisement,are there app is excellent.",positive
very nice music experience thanku for spotify,positive
"i cant even listen to my own songs, last time you can but now you can't, this app sucks",negative
absolutely horrible every update it's even harder to get the song you want to play i installed it just so i don't have to install songs and i don't want to pay just to listen to the song that i want to :(,negative
the app is super awesome... i got no complains... i'm so so happy... some songs don't have lyrics i think they have to sort that out but so far so goodðÿ‘ðÿ¾,positive
spotify is really great. i love the sound quality and the way it creates playlists for you is crazy. i only listen to spotify songs and it's so amazing!!!,positive
"free version is garbage! i do not mind an ad every few songs. the free version adds songs to your playlists. can not skip them. you can not play individual songs, shuffle play only. you can only skip 6 songs per hour. uninstalled",negative
great app for music,positive
more and more if u buy premium and if it's end u more ads,negative
the quality is good but the only problem is adds .... it contains a lot of adds plzz remove the adds,negative
"playing meditation music at night - cuts off after 30 seconds. during the day, can drive 8hrs and not have it cut off. adjusted all the settings so that it has full background access, no luck. super disappointed.",negative
app having nice song collection but the app shows partiality in treating languages. when hearing hindi songs lyrics comes in hindi script however while hearing tamil songs lyrics comes in english script. if tamil songs lyrics also comes in tamil script. it will be ðÿ˜š.,positive
amazing app always calms my mood after a long streeful day ðÿ˜š,positive
this app gets really annoying when i try open it it never actually opens properly and it takes me an hour just to open it don't recommend,negative
"used to be a great app. but now if you're a samsung galaxy user there is no more visible player. which means you can't pause, start, stop, skip or go back a track. it also now crashes regularly. i've been a premium user without these issues for years, but now it is hardly worth the subscription. it would be useful if spotify could rectify these issues enabling the user to have some sort of listener control. update: it had been fixed but now the same issue is happening again in july 2022.",negative
"it's a very nice app, specifically for music but there's only one catch that the ads are so annoying",negative
why don't you just play ads instead of songs?,negative
"worst app, if you want to listen ads thn listen sportify, but if you are interested in songs thn plz find another app",negative
good music app i like it,positive
some time only lag.............,negative
why my spotify error when i want to log out. i have try to uninstall and install it again but this app can't fix. please help me to fix the appðÿ˜­ðÿ˜­ðÿ˜­,negative
i'm unable to open app. if i go onto the internet i'm able to view my playlist however i can't click on the app itself to take me there anymore which is frustrating.,negative
i enjoy spotify and have been using it for quite a while. my only gripe with it is that when listing to an artists mix i wish they played more of the artist and less of the similar artists.,negative
"i dont know whether i am using this app for listening music or listening to adds!! after ever 60 seconds of addd, if i change the 2-3 song quickly, it gives the yt shorts add again withing fur seconds.. it seems like i would have to uninstall this app. cause its really annoying.",negative
the new update is not the best it doesn't let u listen to the music u like,negative
i mostly enjoy the app. i have over 4000 songs downloaded. recently the option to shuffle play has disappeared and it plays the same songs over and over. i knew that i can make playlists but again it's the same thing over and over.,negative
the pc spotify version is greater than this version. it doesn't need premium to skip/unshuffle the songs,positive
"i've been using it for years, but i started having issues with my downloaded songs during these past weeks. the songs get stuck at 4seconds in and won't load. even if they are downloaded. i'm now trying to uninstall and reinstall it ..",negative
i rate this 1 star bc when i play my favorite song it keeps playing on different song which making me hate this app. plss fix this,negative
"hi!i have been using spotify for a while but now i just can't play any playlist or song ,it keeps saying something is wrong ,my internet and everything is very well working ,and this problem annoys me alot so pls fix this ,leaving this evrthing else is fine.",negative
"when i try to play a song it always shows"" this playlist is empty. go to home to find playlists just for you. how to resolve this issue?",negative
"i cant open this app no matter what, its stuck literally and the worst thing is 8 have paid for premium, i have paid and cant use it just because this stupid app just dont responds. i have tried restart, reinstall and everything btw this sucks!",negative
it's spotify. there's nothing bad about it,positive
its a very very good up i can't complain with it but the problem is the ad's i know you can buy premium but it's kinda annoying every 30 minutes to have a 30sec ad maybe do it every hour or something like that,negative
"this app is perfect but i giving 3 stars because the many songs i search was not found by spotify. the soundcloud was the best it have every song when i search. please add the turkish,arabic and remix lofi it is miss in spotify. please fix it and add. thanks",positive
"3 ads per skip is bollocks when the chance of hearing the song you requested is already a 1/5 gamble unless they like what you request. sepultura, slayer",negative
still learning to navigate the programming. guess i have to go to premium because the commercials are annoying,negative
"app crashes every all the time. and ad plays, it crashes. you switch to another app and comeback to spotify, app crashes. always have to restart the app.",negative
"i cant skip songs now, i got only 6 skips per hour. like what the hell bro? i just want to listen to music normally, not to wait until song end. im not using this anymore sorry guys",negative
after every single song it plays add n they r heavily annoying even after update they haven't realized its annoying to keep such thing they removed the feature 30min ad free after a video add better to see other option,negative
"it doesn't play the music i like, it doesn't leave my main screen. i just hate it",negative
"i like how i can play any songs i want, although it can only be 6 skips.",positive
i love bts songs sooo much thank for providing this allðÿ˜‡ðÿ˜‡,positive
"would give higher, but lately the app will not even load.",negative
some other songs are not available like bts song and other things is ok please sort out this thing why bts songs is not available,negative
it works great but sometimes has some issues of quality audio.,negative
excellent app....ðÿ‘ easy to use..lots of options... enjoying the music so much...,positive
great to listen to music,positive
best music app i have ever used,positive
this app is getting worse it's meant to be free and you get 30 minutes without no adverts and i am still getting 6 adverts i can only listen to music for 15 minutes it for 15 minutes then i get more adverts,negative
"i love spotify, i listen to the podcast and i listen to a ton of music, i have over 2,000 songs saved and i have a premium account and have had one for a while, would recommend spotify to anyone and i do.",positive
the app has been great however recently when l search a song it plays a totally different song from the one l choose.,positive
good music listing app,positive
"i used to love the app but now all my downloaded songs are u downloaded and i had to download them again but i can't i tried several times but it just won't download again so i tried downloading other songs abd again no luck! i have premium so i can't say sth about skipping and stuff but i think that since the last hupdate spotify is just ðÿ’©. it's lagging 24/7, and i can't even listen to music offline cuz it just won't play. please fix those issues spotify!!",negative
this aap is so cool i find any song on this ðÿ‘,positive
"the apps doing really good on my end, although when i exit and play a song when i get back on the song doesn't show on the bottom. i wish we could pin more than 4 playlists on my library. other than that i still love spotify<3",positive
mine is not connecting with the internet and i just subscribe to premium my app is crashing,negative
best app ever created in this world 5 star without any doubt.....if u have a doubt then go duck yourself... thanks...,positive
idk what you guys did with the interface but it feels like i have less control.,negative
"very rare to not find a song i'm looking for.....it happens, but not often. even obscure music is available, i love that the lyrics are offered with most songs.... i'll never not have spotify",positive
"this app has major link and playback issues. i use it on android os12. firstly, you cannot play a direct song that is shared to you via social media. when you press the green play button to the bottom right of the song title the app simply ignores it and plays whatever it wants from random artists. if you enter your savedplaylist the same thing happens. this is very biased copyright playback since the specific artists on spotify cannot get there own music played per share. fix it.",negative
i really love spotify but app it's not working please fix it,negative
"whenever i start a radio based off a song or artist (which is with the intention to find a new artist or new music that is related to the song/artist i'm starting the radio off of) it just creates essentially a playlist of music i've been listening to - and not even within the same genre off the song. i've realized that i haven't found any new artists or any new music, and just continuously listen to the same things over and over again which is quite depressing.",negative
"along with the wrapped for a year, spotify should also give the count for the number of ads given per year . other than the too many ads , it is good for listening to music",positive
exilent sound full hd .. no ads problem.. i love spotify... friends download this app without any doubt .. it's my opinion sarojsk,positive
"this is the best music platform, i admit to that especially when the user subscribes to it. but certain problems i'm not so happy with is that it doesn't refresh and show recently released hits. i'll have to see them in other apps them download them on spotify or follow the artist. i'll still give it a complete rating, 'cause the updates lately are good. it'd be satisfactory if i hear an artist dropped a track and i see it quickly on the home page. please work on this. it'd be acknowledged",positive
"no auto artist and album list. it is should be all about the songs. if i like the song, the artist and album should be generated into an auto list.",negative
i was happy with the app because it holds all the artists i like with very few gaps. until i bought bluetooth phones and discovered that it constantly stutters audio playback - the only app to do so. there's a very long discussion thread on the spotify community going back to april 2017 with a multitude of other users who never found a solution. some resorted to the competition because the company clearly doesn't care. i'm also considering that.,negative
"it's a nice music app but then when i play a song from a playlist, it plays a suggested song, which i find annoying. i just want to listen to the songs i added in the playlist, not the suggested songs.",negative
"upd: watch your language spotify and don't command me like that: ""update your payment methods now!"". i won't update anything if i don't want to. i'm tired that i can't add to blacklist one specific track from recommendations/radios. i block it every day and spotify continues to add it in my auto generated playlists. it's hard to reorder playlist in android app.",negative
i am giving you 2 stars . songs are definitely cool with good quality but your advertisement are too much long i use youtube because we can skip in 5 sec but your ads are too long ðÿ˜‘,negative
"i've been using this app since it come about and have always had premium and in recent years it's just getting worse an worse, what is the need to redownload the same song every day spotify?! i hardly pick new songs to go into my playlists and every single day the app is downloading said playlist for offline use. then taking extra long to search or even add to que, i never complain about apps but this is by far becoming one of the most unreliable apps for music.",negative
"i can't listen to what i want, why shuffling songs in an album or playlist against my will ? damn! pls fix this..",negative
"amazing user interface, i'm able to listen to my favorite music and podcasts. awesome app",positive
it's good till it gets glitches.,positive
very good app for streming music,positive
"easiest and most convenient way for a student to stream music, but the app can be considerably buggy on my samsung s8 *edit* bugs still persist on samsung s21.",negative
they remove all the good song. stupidify!,negative
download spotify mod apks instead of real apk...we are here to listen music not ads,negative
"i love listening songðÿž§ this app is soooooooooo perfect i am from west bengal i listen hindi , english, bengali, arabaic all songs",positive
i dont know what's happening because my spotify won't log in and not opening as well when i'm using my data. i got an error always!,negative
the now playing bar has disappeared,negative
the app is very easy to use and it sounds great! my problem with it is that it keeps playing suggested songs in my all my playlists even though it has over 50 artists and songs in it.,negative
"amazing app for songs, it's one of the best i've used of all for music...... there are just too many ads but everything is exceptional and premium was also good.",positive
nice sound quality,positive
awesome app with not just music but valuable podcasts.,positive
"i've used spotify for years, it works without issue, and there's loads of brilliant user submitted playlists to choose from. there is ads every so often but you can go ad free, if you prefer. unlike youtube you can close the screen with your music or podcast playing in the background, which is why its my music app of choice.",negative
":) would be cool if everyone gets the premium package so everyone can use the account instead of just for 1 person, and with the discount price of a student. music is life.",negative
it is the best music app i have ever seen..,positive
love spotify music.,positive
"this app is good... i don't know why there is no older songs like 80-90s songs and famous songs like boys, visvasam,sivaji movies and so on .so pls add some tamil songs from 2000-2021 and also recent movies songs",positive
"hi spotify devs, i like using spotify but as of late the app has been unresponsive. i logged out of my spotify account and since then the app would open but i wouldn't be able to login or access the homepage or anything. the app stays stuck on a screen just showing the spotify logo. can someone help me fix this please",negative
"this app was really good but the new update ruin the app, i just can play the song that i want for a second. please fix it, thanks.",negative
"far too many ads, basic things that should be free such as playing a singular song you want to listen to. you have to pay for",negative
"i accidentally delete the spotify data, yeah that's my fault. but i try to reinstall it and now i just stuck in the logo loading screen",negative
i like the app but the shuffle option is disturbing pls remove it,negative
very addective and super play list,positive
its an easier way to listen to music! it's honestly better than listening to music on youtube. i love this!,positive
it's awesome it just sucks that u have to pay for it,positive
i love this app but the new update is annoying. i know that's on purpose to make us buy premium. giving us ads is enough. not allowing us to choose or change the music and making shuffle disabled for us is annoying. i'll still give it a 4/5 cause i've been using this app for years already but i just haven't bought the premium.,negative
googd app advertisments tloud.... much too loud speaker volume to 50% but advertisments are 80%-90% or louder too bad,negative
"i've been using for 5 years , it's awesome , it's an app that i use daily, i've been using premium for a long time and i have absolutely no regrets , money well spent .",positive
it's really ok and impacting but not all needed are available on spotify.,positive
spotify is also a good application when there is internet and not good when it is offline,positive
the pause play bar has gone missing! please can this be looked at. perhaps something weird in the last update?,negative
had this since 2014. i just hate that the shuffle songs repeat. it's shuffled but in the same pattern every time,negative
i would have given them a 5 only if they made us able to back up or transfer the downloads,negative
"i really liked this application and i advise everyone to download it, but the only problem is when i want to listen to songs without the internet, i can not, but the application is still very good ðÿ˜â™¥ï¸â™¥ï¸",positive
"cuberstalers, cgberbullies, narcissistic hackers bff. the whole guns don't kill people people kill people vail to hide behind. it's a good thing your not spinach then you can be recalled.",positive
"terrible just wants money.... been paying for premium for a year almost and now that i haven't payed they won't even let me in the app to select what playlist i'm listening to, just give me 2 options 1) pay em or 2) cancel which i don't wanna do as my dad is in charge of our duo account. terrible streaming service!!!!",negative
i love this app so much i have no problems with it,positive
basic features such as playing things in order are unavailable without paying,negative
wonderful! keeps me upbeat when i need it,positive
after getting the premium my life became to ease up a bit and i thank spotify ðÿ™ðÿ¾,positive
it is very good app but it's new update is very very bad i am deleting this app ðÿ˜ˆðÿ˜ˆðÿ˜ˆðÿ˜ˆ,negative
"used to be amazing, have been a premium subscriber for 3 + years. the latest update causes spotify not to show the song playing so i can't skip etc. will stop at random intervals so have to manually open phone again. i have uninstalled and reinstalled, problem still persists.",negative
i wish i had premium but otherwise great experience,positive
so it's great but i sort of miss pandã·/ra. spotify is awesome; however it's not life i've ever been to vietnam. i got phished! be careful.,positive
very irritating. i want to stream music over mobile data and says no internet connection seriously....... furthermore i am a premium user but still suffer. please check on that as soon as you can.,negative
"spotify is literally the worst platform you could use to listen to podcasts. they insert ads that aren't associated with the podcast makers and it makes podcasts sound disjointed. premium doesn't even help in that regard. some podcast episodes are also missing random 20 second snippets of audio, which aren't missing on other platforms so this is on spotify's end. most likely some kind of bug related to the aforementioned ads inserted into episodes by spotify themselves.",negative
"the app sound is amazing,i using some time",positive
spotify are tha best any music you have all thanks,positive
"best app to listen to your favourite music anytime ,anywhere.",positive
why don't you guys add a minus one feature for every song. like a karaoke. since you already have lyrics on some songs.,negative
auto play random songs. it is non sense frustrating. i have set auto play off and it still skip and plays random stuff. utter garbage. good quality in song is not answer to the random song recommendation.,negative
now this aap is vary vary bad i don't like it because any song if i play this is no playðÿ–¤ðÿ¤®ðÿ’©ðÿ‘žðÿ˜¤ðÿ˜¡ðÿ˜ ðÿ¤¬,negative
"july 6th, 2022. just came back to spotify today around 03:37, i'm not amused on how the audio devices i'm using currently onto bluetooth and aux cable too, i used to have a quite different experience than a lower mono-audio about now. by the way; the sound was needed to be up around 94% oye. ad's are fine but gives you 30 minutes of listing to music; but other devices that i use this app isn't the same, i only use shuffle mode.",negative
awesome reference to my favorite tunes,positive
full with entertainment,positive
its good and choice in your hands.....,positive
app shuffles my playlist and took all my skips and plays songs that aren't even on my playlist,negative
"waste app not opening in my tap only spotify symbol is visible and every time coming ads on tv download spotify,for party all are fake ðÿ˜ˆðÿ˜ˆðÿ˜ˆðÿ˜¢ðÿ˜¤",negative
you should try to suggest some new and hits songs. and also make some other list for hit songs,negative
super audio quality,positive
spotify is wow i love it and i will recommend people to use it,positive
"best ever music app i ever experienced is spotify. never witnessed any song unavailable and that's the best thing about it. but still , in offline music(without premium) ,it include lot of ads which can be considered as "" excess"".",negative
i love this app so much i love the music and everything about it. the podcats i really enjoy it's really interesting.,positive
"worst app ever. they give songs between ads, i mean how can they even put songs between the ads , it just ruins the joyful exprience of listening to the ads. if they remove the songs i will definitely give them 5 stars.",negative

mind blowing app so easy to use and it's amazing ðÿ˜‰â¤ï¸,positive
"the only place where i can get both music and podcasts. great! i would not live without it. the only reason i do not have premium anymore is that i have got another music streaming service through my phone subscribtion - if i had not, i would definitely still subscribe to spotify. edit: have you considered adding ratings to your podcasts/songs? that would be nice.",negative

"this app is trash, needs premium to anything ðÿ˜¤ðÿ™„, can't listen to any songs i like, always bringing me to another song, i'm already giving credit on streaming an artist and you can't even let me do that!!! ðÿ‘žðÿ‘žðÿ‘žðÿ‘žðÿ‘žðÿ‘žðÿ‘žðÿ‘ž",negative
"i really enjoy spotify premium and have so for the last few years as a subscriber. after recently updating my phone, my spotify no longer plays anything. all my saved data is gone. the titles and playlists are there but nothing plays. it keeps saying no internet connection try again. i have followed all the troubleshooting options as well. i only just resubscribed 3 weeks ago ðÿ˜ž",negative
this is truely the best music app i have ever used and i've tried a lot of them. i love my music and this app has all the music. from the golden oldies to the latest.,positive
"it's been glitchy lately and music skips like scratched cd. and today, when i tried opening the app, it stayed at the logo and wouldn't load. i tried uninstall and install again, restarting my phone doesn't work either.",negative
"somehow varying streaming quality, maybe due to connection ...",negative
the only god thing is that you can share instagram stories with that pretty lyric thing and that's it,negative
crashing and closing all the time,positive
too much ads ðÿ¥²ðÿ¥²ðÿ¥²,negative
"been going downhill for years (the ui to find anything is terrible, sound quality is average and when you download something it favourites it?!) but the way it struggles without an internet connection is infuriating, it just shows a loading screen all the time, even for albums i've downloaded. i've downloaded them because i'm travelling and i know my connection is going to be bad so why am i staring at a loading screen",negative
it's good but why can i not play the song i want to play. it always plays a different song than i'm picking. and 6 skips per hour? that's stupid,negative
"well i gave it a four star rating because when i play a song it just keeps on playing the song in my playlist and i can remove the song when i fully exit the app,so it's pretty annoying. other than that,i really like everything else just besides the annoying part.so it's a pretty good app to me",positive
"never a boring moment with spotify,search it you will find itðÿ˜š",positive
i've been using this app for years but recently somethings up with the app please fix it. sometimes the music just starts playing but there is no way to stop it. i can't get the album cover of song i'm listening up. there has been other issues are a recent thing. please fix it,negative
"they were unexceptionally smart to give me spotify premium free for 3 months... after that 3 months i couldn't bear with the ads and i literally became a premium member for good. its the best music streaming app but fyou for taking my money by playing mind games. jk just buy premium duo with a friend, its affordable.",positive
can't open the app anymore,negative
very interesting app for music lovers,positive
great! only problem is that sometimes it can glitch out a bit but it doesn't do that often,negative
fantastic music from top stars always available.,positive
"recently the app has been randomly losing the player. can't close the app, can't stop what's playing. argh! been using the app for years and have loved it. this needs to be fixed - please! update july 5, 2022 seemed to have returned to normal until today - same issue. am un-installing and re-installing.",positive
awesome app ðÿ‘œ no ads,positive
best choice for listening music,positive
what does it mean first you say listen 30 minutes of uninterrupted music then after one song you advertise again it would be better if you don't say it that 30 minutes of uninterrupted music,negative
it would be nice if we can download music and listen offline,negative
"the mobile version is absolute thrash i can't even choose the song to play, i can only choose a playlist with full of songs that i don't like.",negative
this app is great. it has all of my favorite music in one playlist!!! ðÿ•º,positive
"the shuffle button isn't on all playlist. music stops after 10 secs even after going into the app. also, i thought if i had the premium duo plan then it would get rid of ads. why do ads still come up on podcast?? updat: we are now in a july and it's still happening.. remind me why i pay for this sub???? first review was from back in april 2022. maybe if the music wouldn't keep stopping randomly it would make more sense.",negative
"what is going on with all the bugs? spotiy has always been wonderful until the last few months. bugs, skips, doesn't pop up what im currently listening to, so i can't pause or stop the music without having to close the app. i'm really hoping this gets fixed and i dont have to cancel my subscription â˜¹ï¸",negative
it says ad free music ad free music only in between ads ðÿ’¥ðÿ”ªðÿ”ªðÿ”ªðÿ˜­,negative
i play music on my pc. and set pc playback on mobile to. it still doesn't change songs on pc. lags a lot. makes it annoying. please fix it.,negative
extensive collection with great recommendations!,positive
best free streaming app,positive
all i know now is spotify âœ¨ðÿ¤§,negative
"in general the app is good, but recently when i play music it will occasionally not show the notification to show what song is playing or the app will freeze, i also can't unhide songs. please fix these issues.",negative
"unusable, songs will not even play and the app crashes constantly",negative
very nice app to listen to your favorite artist,positive
"spotify is great except two things. #1, it would be so much funner if it notified you when people followed you or notifed others when you follow them, i'm following countless friends who have no idea. it could be so much better. and #2, if you don't pay you lose access to listening to your playlists, youtube music still let's you listen to your playlists when you don't pay, the only difference is having ads or not having ads. i hate that spotify cuts you off.",negative
app works great. many features.,positive
"now playlist only can be played, but didnt show the list so i cant skip any song i want to hear. sometimes i want to hear song i like in the playlist multiple time.",negative
"i love spotify. i can create my own playlists, and just listen for hours.",positive
had spotify for around 10 years planning on going another 10.,negative
"its a good app, good music, but the new update is horrible. why do i have to shuffle my liked songs just to listen to music? why cant i tap on the song to listen to the full song and not a sample of the song? it doesn't really make sense but it does what its supposed to do which is play music. also the ads make me feel like i have malware on my phone with it popping up randomly.",negative
great choices of music and seem to be for free speech so you get 5* from me boo,negative
stopps playing playlists after just a few minutes,negative
i am fine without needing to pay for music so i get ads but i hate everything else. i should not need to pay to see what songs are in a album suggested songs should be optional and skips do not reset at all i have not opened spotify in 5 days so how do i have no skips they have fixed all this so ya use spotify,negative
"love it, this app is great for creating playlists and finding the music you love. i also love the ability to download playlists for when you have no internet.",positive
"new ui with the play button in the left most just feels weird, please fix it to the standard button layout.",negative
its better to pirate musics than using this... no youtube is better.,negative
"in first time, this app is disatified for me. i try to creat account but always reply to me something wrong. free log in,log in with facebook, log in with google account like that show me but can't sing in. what a uselsss app.",negative
im stuck at loading screen,negative
i have never been happier with a music provider. i tuned out after 10 years and literally thousands of dollars. it will take me the rest of my life of all available music to make up for it.,positive
"it literally is stuck on the logo and wont let me play my songs, go to home page or anywhere its just stuck at the logo.",negative
this is a grate app for music streaming.,negative
used to like it but now you have to pay for basic fetures. you are forced to listen to random songs even if your trying to listen to one song. its annoying.,negative
the computer version is way better,positive
in my opinion spotify beats all of the music apps out there hands down.........,positive
removed features being used by the client base without any notice. rather go to youtube music then continue paying spotify money. bring back spotify connect function and i'll take my review back.,negative
"the reason for less stars is the ads are becoming irritating. this app used to be having a non interrupting playback for 30 minutes or so if you saw an ad between. but now it have ads after almost every songs. and it used to have an option for checking the song by giving a 10 second or so sample of it before adding the song to a playlist if you add the songs by ""add songs"" option in the playlist. now it doesn't work. please bring it back. and please allow us to rearrange the songs in a playlist",negative
i don't know i if it's just me but every time i play my like songs it will play but later i will play song that i never liked or is interested in ðÿ˜¬ðÿ˜¬,positive
"this app is soo goodd i can listen to fav songs, and im not gonna find or download it in google or anything, i can just find it in spotifyðÿ¤ðÿ§¡ðÿ”¥",negative
very good i like all music is nice,positive
it a good app but how can i not pick the songs i want to play and only get 6 skips an hour it's so annoying why can't i pick my own songs. so after 6 skips your stuck listening to songs i don't want to listen to at the moment why can't i pick the song like on every other device,negative
too much ads ðÿ˜”ðÿ˜”ðÿ˜”,negative
"love you all except when the ads come in, then i just want to storm your office and dump your servers into the sea. ðÿ’›",negative
i would give this 5 stars but the fact that you cant choose wich songs you want is dumb af.,negative
best music app out. would recommend buying nyse: spot,positive
my spotify app is showing a ton of music from others countries. i need american music. how do i fix that?,negative
please focus on music not add,negative
i want to download spotify songs to my library on my conputer. please advise how to do this,negative

"u love spotify because jungkook, v and bts' songs is there.",positive
good for streaming! ðÿ‘,positive
ads are good bcs tells abt new songs which are beautiful but smtimes it's is not good bcs u r listening ur fvrt song,negative
"good app, however, every time i want to add a specific song to my playlist, it shows me recommend songs rather than the song i want to look at and add. edit: now, when ever i try to look at a new song or playlist, it gives me infinite adds. wost music app ever. uninstall and move to youtube people.",positive
i pick a song it will change into random music,negative
too much ads. don't tell me to switch to premium. don't have a card for it.,negative
great app when it works. i've tried multiple times to get it to stop playing in the background to no avail. next option is to just delete it and cancel subscription.,negative
app is hot garbage and has been for years. i pay for the service and am plagued by crashes and random stoppages. persistent notification for playback will break for no reason. downloads will corrupt and leave you with no offline music.,negative
spotify is the best app for listening music it has all the features i have never seen before ðÿ˜„ðÿ˜„âœœï¸,positive
"i like this app but i hate it when we only get six skips per hour ,and when there is a song i did not put in my playlist, i really hope that changes but overall is still good",positive
"since june i've been having lots of problems with my podcasts and songs suddenly i'm playing and it stops and i can't press stop the songs, this is really incovenience, please try to fix this asap this is really annoying.",negative
it's a good app but there are few things bad with it it has a 6 hour wait to it when u skip like 4. or 3 songs #2 it skips randomly for no reason #3 u can pick ur own song u just have to hope it's the first one here is a good thing u can actually change the song without it being random in daily mixes,negative
all good. i've been with them for years . one time couldn't pay my bill on time. and they paid for 2 months. do i half to say anymore. thank u. . j bird.,positive
way too many ads. plays 1 or 2 songs and then multiple ads then does it again. very annoying when trying to listen to music.,negative
i haven't been able to enjoy music on any other app like i am this one (spotify) and creating an account is completely free!,negative
very good app.i listen to lots of music on hear,positive
ok this app is good but please remove limited skips i have the subscription for it and i love it but the free version is just so bad so make it so you have unlimited skips the ads are fine but the limited skips are just bad so please remove that,negative
make the ads a little shorter and its all good,negative
i can't play the music that i want to listen the whole albums starts playing.. please fix that thing up,negative
"dear spotify, your app is great. but my eyes bleed when i see the background color of lyrics on desktop version. please change it to softer color.",negative
"i thought deezer was bad but spotify i can't even login, keeps saying you're offline when i'm definitely online. i can't be stressing my brains just to access music, i'm out",negative
would be great but the 5 30 second ads kinda ruin it,negative
"what the heck is going on with this app? it was great and now it skips and when i open the app to turn off what i'm listening to, the player at the bottom has disappeared and i can't turn it off without closing the app. restarting the phone and the app only helps temporarily. reinstalling the app only works temporarily. i have loved spotify but am considering switching to amazon music because of this nonsense.",negative
this app is the best way to listen to music,positive
"great app i've been using it for years and have paid for my subscription. for the last few days there is no way to stop, skip or fast forward the songs. i have to close the entire window to get music to stop playing. please fix.",positive
"spotify app on pc is great, you can't doubt that. although the moment you just wanna travel with music on a phone its so horrible, theres this bug possibly where you're locked on shuffle mode. you can't even have fun with music anymore because spotify does everything possible to make it unfun.",negative
it's a good music app but i don't understand why i just cannot continue to skip freely from one track to another. why restrict the number of times one can skip tracks while listening to a playlist.,negative
suddenly if u put songs in shuffle..the first song plays again and again please do check this,positive
the quality of music got worse when i got premium the transitions between songs slowed down and wouldn't load as fast,negative
"two days ago all songs from playlists i listened to were showed in the history of songs i listened to recently as just songs, i mean there werenâ€™t any playlists and then songs from them, just songs. it confuses searching now, nothing has changed yet. i need answers, i have no idea whatâ€™s happening, and it extremely complicates using this app. upd: why canâ€™t i download music lol? what now? nothing changed either.",negative
great app! one problem! stop politicizing the ads! i download it to listen to music not hear about lgbtq or abortion or vaccines.,negative
can't open the app anymore. what the heck is going on?,negative
great tunes and selection,positive
been listening to spotify for years. never have been asked to rate it. got a new phone and it wants to know what i think. if i didn't like it i'd be using another platform.,negative
"it's a wonderful music app, and i definitely recommend. however, one issue i have is the imbalance between the different platforms. pc, almost everything you want from the app besides ""no ads"". tablet, quality is kinda the same on pc, but different because it's a tablet. phone, god, it needs to improve. ads, sure whatever, i get it. but not being able to choose what song to listen to and only 6 skips an hour? what if someone can't afford a tablet or pc? rethink this, because it's stupidly unfair",negative
the recent update has rendered this the most annoying app on my phone. constantly losing the playing bar. used to work without issues. huawei p30 pro,negative
i've been usthis for a while and figured they deserved of this reading i've been using this and i've never had no problems with it it's a little expensive but worth it,positive
really love playing spotify,positive
"nvm, free spotify sucks",negative
"wow... i moved from ios to android and the lack of care for android is astonishing. i'm a software engineer and i would have been fired months ago if i released something this buggy and didn't even bother to fix it. this is not acceptable. it's not that it's buggy, it's that there is no care to fix it. each new release makes the app more and more unstable. probably priority is ios and android just gets the crumbs.",negative
best music streaming service i have ever used. ui is simple and sophisticated. spotify also features many personalization options that makes the app feel like it was built for you.,positive
"i really don't care about the random pauses in the music. what upsets me is that after 14 days, everything is on shuffle. like, you cannot pick a certain song on a playlist. basically, it is forcing you to buy premium or else you will always be annoyed.",negative
"the best ever music app after google play store, with great quality sound n other effects. specially the premium plan is so worth it. ðÿ‘ðÿ˜‰ðÿ˜‡",positive
nice listening to wonderful music!,positive
"don't use this app, don't give your money to spotify. switch to bandcamp and actually support artists and not be force fed platform exclusives daily or be bombarded with ads in your listening. latest update appears to have completely borked the shuffle function, frequently goes over songs that were playing only minutes before.",negative
"spotify is very greedy, as in the free plan it puts shuffle on and it can't be turned off at all, and so many other things like that are added so you have to get premium. not worth it, get pandora.",negative
"can't listen to music, playlists for all are showing empty. tried uninstalling, clearing cache, rebooting...nothing has helped. i have a paid subscription and can't use the service. update: customer support was quick to address the issue and offered an easy solution to the problem. thank you.",negative
"well, what does this app offer that needs rating? it collects and plays the work of others well. displays the artwork of others well. its homepage is straight bad and mostly pushing things i will never and have never clicked on. they should have a ""simple"" mode that gets rid of all the faff and lets you just listen to music. after all, it doesn't pay its artists, so why does it need to advertise? i already pay for it!",negative
it's a good app just i don't like how i have to spend so much a month and only 6 skips pur hour it's should be six skips pur 30 minutes so when a add comes on we will get some skips,positive
it was nice and i loved to listen to music to drown out the noises or to draw but one day i was off to listen to music but it didn't let me choose music and i thought it was a glitch so i uninstalled the app the reinstalled it back but it still happened please put it to that we can choose the song and not randomize it,positive
"why won't my playlist restart? i keep starting my podcast so i can draw stuff but then it'll start in the middle of a song and it'll completely throw off the mood, why won't it restart the playlist instead of picking some random song to start in and then play that song and not let me to skip",negative
"i pay for my monthly subscription and the same day it quits working. tried uninstalling,, clearing data, clearing cache, restarting etc. can't get past initial logo screen. so who's refunding my money????",negative
"it has alot of songs of any genre, and if you pay the premium then it just gets better and better, 10/10 recommended",positive
the february update broke spotify connect to my car's bluetooth radio is no longer able to connect to spotify,negative
"i can't play any song that i pick, randomly cuts halfway through a song and 6 skips an hour shouldn't be a feature, i have no trouble with this on a console, like playstation but this is just generally unusable.",negative
"what happen to the canvas? i can't skip to next songs (both on phone and bluetooth), cannot select loop, random, or direct, can't see the lyrics, and can't skip through songs. please fix this",negative
"i am begging you, improve the offline functionality. song that are supposed to be downloaded won't play, the menues are buggy as hell offline and half the time will just not load, sometimes i can't even pull up my library.",negative
i did love using spotify! not anymore since i'm annoyed that all of my playlists are gone for some reason...,negative
i really like it. easy to use and customize.,positive
"great app, always has up to date music and i can generally always find the songs i'm looking for. i hate ad's so it's definitely worth the monthly subscription. i love listening to music while commuting and spotify helps make the journey less boring.",positive
"a new updaye and same issue as below. last time i had to contact support to fix it. used to love it. a few weeks ago after an update, i stopped seeing a notification in my pull down menu. the app is also switching to playing on the phone after i turned the car off post bluetooth. neither of these were ever an issue, i changed nothing about my phone setup.",negative
"right now as soon as i start vacation it is not working, not loading. i've uninstalled, reinstalled, forced stopped, restarted my phone. this is beyond annoying!!! edit, got a new phone and app still not working!!! everyone else in my family plan has a working spotify except myself and i am the plan account holder.",negative
i'm an artist and spotify doesn't even let me listen to my own song. it keeps playing other songs that i don't like :)),negative
"great music,all the songs l grew up with at the push of a button.",positive
we love our spotify!,positive
excellent perfomence with greatest hearing experience... the sound system ðÿ’¯,positive
i love spotify so much but i have two reasons why i don't like it. 1) i hate the ads. 2) premium is good but expensive and it made me broke,positive
the only reason i returned to this god awful app is to watch jre. although i haven't been able to in over a year because their mobile app is so poorly made i'll end up waiting five minutes for something to load just for it to buffer every twenty seconds without fail. beyond frustrating to use even without the ads. i couldn't recommend this app any less and i personally believe an honest to god 8-track would be an improvement to whatever the hell spotify claims to be.,negative
easy to use and very popular so it has a wide selection of music,positive
everything costs. and the random songs being added to your playlist is annoying.,negative
"fix the app! keeps crushing, plays what ever it wants, doesn't react, if i want to switch it off i need to close it from the background.",negative
the sound quality and other features are exceptional.,positive
how come when we use spotify on computer we can loop for free but when we use it on phone we gotta pay. cmon man thats just stupid,negative
good music i can find heheh even old music hehe,positive
whenever i open the app and numerous times while using it i get a message that i should turn on bluetooth. i know bluetooth is off. i turned it off. there are no bluetooth devices where i am. it has become so annoying that i am looking for an alternative,negative
spotify is great for listening to albums. and it's cool to be able to make playlists.,positive
"spotify gives you access to a lot of music, but often fails at functionally working. it doesn't have all the albums i want but has an interesting way of recommending new music.",positive
"if i were to compare, spotify is the best music app for me. i love the interface sm! although there are some bugs and stuffs, they didn't hinder me much from having a good experience in this app. i hope you'd add more songs and improve the sound quality just like am (it's already good but i don't think it would hurt if you make it better hehe)",positive
my app won't even open... i have tried reinstalling it and it still won't work..,negative
good but can be a bit confusing and difficult. sometimes u search and play ur particular song and pops up a total different one . spotify should really work on that,positive
the app will not open to the log in page,negative
"fix spotify, i have explicit content on, yet it won't let me play the songs, fix this please.",negative
you can't always view video or track at what point in the audio the song is. why? this is a problem that amazon and youtube do not encounter.,negative
"spotify was great until all of a sudden i logged out for 1 quick second and now i can't load into the app and i'm stuck in the loading screen with the logo for the past 3 days, it'd be 5 stars if this was fixed.",negative
"been having this problem recently where i am only stuck on a spotify logo basically the loading screen where i have to wait before it loads. i've been waiting a lot just to see the damn loading screen for hours. i tried uninstalling and redownloading it but nothing works i tried a lot of ways such as restarting my phone, clearing data and cache, refreshing the app but nothing happens just that damn logo and a black screen surrounding it. i can't believe this. fix this damn app.",negative
"spotify was best in the beggining, you can play any song you like and i believe to be add free, however like 1 month after download when i click a song it doesn't even even play the song i chose. i don't know if this happens with other people on mobile however it is very annoying click a song only to hear something else.",negative
"free spotify tends to get more insidious the more you use it to frustrate you into paying for premium, to the point that it would play 2 songs then 3 ads repeatedly",negative
"after using over five(5) music ðÿžµ apps , this is one of many i give a five(5)+ðÿœÿðÿœÿðÿœÿðÿœÿðÿœÿðÿ”¥ in which i enjoy sharing with family and friends. also , you can creat your own playlist ðÿž§ðÿž¶ðÿžµðÿž§ and share .... ðÿ”#1ðÿž­âœ¨âœ¨ðÿ‘",positive
"the last time i tuned in, it kept flicking from one song to another, and wouldn't let me listen to the song that i wanted to.",positive
"it just stops playing music and podcast it will work for a song or two or 10 minutes into a podcast then it just stops, play bar is going like you just started the app up, doesn't remember that played a song or where it stopped in song or podcast. then you have to go back in the app find where you stopped hearing the content. got full bars, 5g unlimited plan no where near the ramp down limit so it's not that. pandora and utube music play just fine. starting to wonder why i pay for this when it",negative
"it's nice, but there are too many things to pay for",negative
"my spotify has been working fine for 5 years. i cleared the app data to clear some space on my phone. now when i click onto the app, it doesnt go pass the green logo which im stuck on. cant get to the login screen or anything. please fix this spotify is my lifeeeeeee",negative
i mostly use the app for exclusive podcasts like jre and appreciate spotify as company as a whole but the app crashes all the time. frequently when i go to listen to a podcast the podcast doesn't come up so if it has video i can't see it or skip ahead or go back within the podcast its as if the app doesn't register its playing. if the app was more reliable i would like consider using it for music and upgrade to premium account but the frustration isn't worth it.,negative
sptify is a nice app . but it dosent let us enjoy the music. ads every second and only 5skips a day! its forcing the user to pay. and thats lame .pls let some freedom for the useres so they dont hate this app.,negative
easy to use and provides great suggestions!,positive
found the app easy to use and your options are limitless,negative
last update won't let the app open!!!!,negative
"my music the way i want it, where i want it... when i want it. love the spotify app!",positive
thumbnail is other artists and songs item list of another artist,negative
the stupidest app really. you take premium for a week and you can download only 30 songs?! disgusting. never spending one more penny on this useless app.,negative
"i love spotify and use is all the time,but the only thing that i don't like about spotify is that it doesn't play all of the songs on the playlist before it repeats some of the songs. but other than that i would definitely recommend it.",positive
"i love spotify. it not only has music i like it also has podcasts that fit my interests. and i don't mean sport or anime podcast even though i haven't looked. i'm talking crime, supernatural, or scary type podcasts.",positive
spotify is an awesome music app.,positive
trash app wouldn't even use if joe rogan hadn't moved over. literally randomly just changed podcasts and pauses for no reason all the time.,negative
"i've been using this app for 4 years,but the new update is getting on my nerves.if you want to listen to a song you can't listen to it first if you even wanted to, instead it puts the songs in a order where you can't choose which one you wanna listen to first. not only that, but when i tap on a song to listen to it instead of showing the play button it shows other songs and not the one i wanted to listen to. it is also frustrating when i wanna play a song on my playlist.",negative
no issue and encountered eversince i installed this app super users friendly and was to link to my car and bt speaker.,negative
i love spotify so much.,positive
"constantly stopping, regularly not showing playback options and offline mode is spotty at best.",negative
why the hell cant i play my playlist do i need to shuffle it? stop trying to give me songs that are like the songs in my playlist. just let me listen to my damn songs its annoying,negative
"the app has horrendous lag on my note 10+ yet works fine on my brother's phone, i am fully updated to the newest version i can, and the issue persists. there is something deeply wrong with this app, and it needs to be figured out soon.",negative
"many problems with this app. #1 you canâ€™t even play the songs you want. every time i shuffle play liked songs or my own playlists it just plays songs that arenâ€™t even there. #2 too much ads. #3 whenever i search for a song, i have to go through every single playlist that appeared till i find the one i want, sometimes i donâ€™t even find it. #4 you have 6 skips every hour but canâ€™t even play what you want so i just skip to the song i want but then my skips are just wasted. you need to fix this.",negative
"really knows how to setup the music, great system ðÿ‘",positive
"the app has such a variety of music and gives new artist so you dont get bored of your favorite artist, however despite the apps quality the add situation is a little abnocious having to pay a fair price with no adds and offline music is a fair deal still the adds should depend on how many months/years your account was created so the longer you have uour account the less adds.",negative
this app is so annoying....after the last update all playlist has under go on shuffle mood and you cant disable it without buy a premium...... and you cant change song over 6 time..... this is so disappointing..... i am going to uninstall this app,negative
sometimes it's laggy for me. crashes often too...(ã€€ï¼›âˆ€ï¼›)...,negative
"since mid may 2022, i can't play anything on spotify. all of my playlists are either empty or have like 2 songs on them. even official spotify playlists are empty. edited: there's been 4 updates since this post and i still can't listen to any music. i pay for this and i can't use it. the website works but i can't download a playlist there so i have to use my mobile data. i'll be switching to pandora, i guess. i prefer spotify but i can't use it! ðÿ˜¡",negative
keeps asking to allow bluetooth. i have said yes and later and it won't stop every time i open the app. so annoying,negative

"great when it works, haven't had too many issues on the pixel 6 pro. control bar is missing with latest update",negative
i used to love this app a lot.... many amazing songs and everything is so perfect ðÿ™‚ðÿ˜‡,positive
i love spotify to be honest wichall,positive
spotify is okay but i can't loop it or choose my song. youtube let's me do that. i can do that on my computer spotify but not mobile. it sucks.,negative
too many ads like gawd i know i have to pay for premium you don't need to give me three 30 seconds long ads continuously even once is enough,negative
since i updated the app won't open.,negative
i love the app and the premium prices are reasonable. the only problem i have is that it's a bit tedious adding songs to a playlist.,negative
i really enjoy this app. the weekly discovery is awesome!,positive
the songs are amazing,positive
"keeps saying no internet, when set to offline, when stuff i'm trying to play is downloaded stuff? turn to online with my wi fi same gd thing? worked great for years now this? why do i pay for premium?",negative
the progress bar issue was fixed and it is the great app it used to be once again,positive
"it's all about the money first of all when i want to listen to a certain playlist via artist or made by myself ,it always play ""suggested"" songs. it so irritating because let alone i can't chose the song i can't get more than 6 skips an hour when it's playing song that shouldn't even be there . i liked it better when the subscription was unlimited skips and no ads ðÿ˜œðÿ˜œðÿ˜œ",negative
"big fan, keeps doing really weird things like not showing that it's playing, unable to fast forward or rewind because i can't get to the song playing, gives me random adds and won't let me skip by then even though i have the payed version.",positive
great so far haven't had to deal with advertising yet,positive
"just a cash grab at this point, they stopped giving me my 30 minutes of uninterrupted music and i don't know why, i can only skip 6 songs (and it's extremely frustrating when a song i don't know comes on that i didn't put on my playlist) i can't even chose the song i want to listen to and the audio keeps skipping during the songs, just use an adblocker website and listen to music that way guys",negative
there was like 1 billion ads and i didn't even get the songs i wanted,negative
its a great app for music and in my opinion the best,positive
not having 30 minutes of commercial listening.,negative
forget this. im going back to youtube. at least there i can listen to the songs i want instead of my 30 ad free minutes being recommendeds of what i listened to last week. 10/10 do not recommend this app. alot of problems built into the app on purpose just to pressure people into buying their premium. premium in their case being a decent app that just lets you listen to your music which i shoukd get anyway. total ripoff,negative
i try to play the song on my play list and play songs i didn't add,negative
love this app but kinda silly how you have to pay to listen i mean seriously! i rather listen to my music on youtube.,negative
i love the more like this tab for podcasts! i love it so much i closed out the app and rated it after years of having spotify ðÿ˜‚ definitely need more changes like this!!!!! comment section next?? ðÿ‘€ðÿ‘€ðÿ‘€,positive

â™¦ï¸â™¦ï¸â™¦ï¸â™¦ï¸â™¦ï¸ðÿž´dont download bad app for misic it contains frequently ad 2:1ratio of ads,negative
currently the play bar is disappearing from the bottom of the app constantly. extremely frustrating and yet marked as resolved according to their website. will be leaving 1 star review until this is fixed properly because it's a core feature that should never be broken (for an extended period of time at that) in a music app.,negative
great music definitely a great app to have.,positive
very good app for music and podcast. but ads are too frequent.,negative
i love the selection of music. oldies that i knew my granny loved that i couldn't find elsewhere.,positive
any other android users having issues with the app? i've read alot of us are experiencing the same issue after updating the app..once it's updated and you try to reopen it stays stuck on the logo....its trying to load up but never does! extremely frustrating when you can't speak to a human. all bots when trying to resolve the issue! back to pandora i go!ðÿ˜­ðÿ˜­ðÿ˜­ðÿ’”ðÿ’”ðÿ’”,negative
i love spotify!! i have always been able to find every song i'm looking for and every podcast too. paying for premium is 100% worth it. spotify is the best app and i choose it over all the others out there. thanks for being amazing spotify ðÿ‘ðÿ˜.,positive
"was terrible, couldn't stand using the app with ads and limited skips... then i got premium. now, all i ever use is spotify. no ads, no taking up phone space, and pretty much all the music i listen to. sometimes i have an itch for a song that isn't available on spotify, so i just youtube it and carry on with my day. the only subscription i won't be getting rid of any time soon :d",negative
"offline mode takes a while to respond, an issue that has plagued 3 of my phones (2x samsung, 1x oppo many android update, app updates and years later still.",negative
spotify is great!,positive
"everything is almost alright. whenever i play my liked songs shuffled, after couple of my liked songs are played a little after you play song that i never liked why play them when i haven't liked them. fix this. not only that every 10 minutes i get an add. don't hmu with the bs of not bothering you with adds for 30 minutes. thanks for disabling my account after i wrote this, everything was fine before i rated this.",positive
performance is very poor when i search for music and i tap the play button it play different much,negative
changing my review from 1 star for the free version. i just got a student subscription and the app works super fast. i am able to listen to songs in different languages (a lot of them with lyrics). the playlists are also useful as i can discover new songs. spotify has got to be the best music player in the world right now. :),positive
spotify was good untill they started the 8 ads in a row deal,positive
constantly crashes with podcasts which is annoying. plus the podcast video player could really use an update.,negative
"very happy, thanks a very good range of fantastic music kind regards from ollie from freezing frankston 3199 victoria lol",positive
"i tried logging in but i keep receiving an error message of ""offline kindly connect to the internet"" which is very annoying because i'm very sure i'm connected to the internet.not until i uninstall and reinstall and now i have to redownload my songs.",negative
"i've been using and paying for spotify premium since i was in 7th grade. i am now a college sophomore and thinking of cancelling my well-loved subscription because of the constant skipping of songs. i don't know why or when exactly the problem started, but almost every song skips like a bad record and i haven't found a single effective solution. reinstalling, reporting the bug, opening and closing ect ect. i love this app and i would hate to lose it, but this issue is incredibly frustrating.",negative
new update is horrible. not being able to pick which song and my playlist constantly shuffling. i recommend soundcloud or youtube music.,negative
"great music app, only problem is that the shuffle feature isnt actually random and it picks the same handful of songs each time.",negative
best app in the world for music lovers1â™¥ï¸,positive
great music selection..,positive
voice is very clear and good,positive
"app constantly plays the same songs regardless of using shuffle. for example, today while not driving the app is playing all the songs it played yesterday while driving. sucks.",negative
"i will never pay for spotify. it's a scam. literally every other song is an ad an then when i am able to catch a commercial free period, you guys ruin it. how do you let a 4 minute song go over 6 mins and had i not used one of your skips my whole 30 minutes would have been wasted on 1 song. it's absolutely ridiculous",negative
it plays every song i could ever imagine having to think of and it is very useful,positive
this is everything i needed thank you spotify,positive
absolutely stunning! more like they know my soul and give me what i want. ðÿ–¤,positive
"what is up with free spotify. i get that i'm not going to get the best version of the app but you only have 6 skips. the 6 skips are that bad but pair it with when you play a playlist it just plays random songs that aren't even on your playlist. so you skip those song but then the app is like: ""woah slow down instead of skipping try editing your playlist?"" and you can't edit your playlist because it's playimg random songs. and when you search noooo it has to play more random songs.",negative
use any other app. constantly stops playing for no reason. sometimes stopping after 5 minutes or less.,negative
"the best app ever they is no song i cannot fine hear toms up ,ðÿ‘ðÿ‘ðÿ‘",positive
"loved it, but then the app started getting really buggy and now it thinks there's no internet access when i can easily connect with other apps. going to cancel subscription.",negative
its a great app but.. since the new update spotify is just noðÿ’€ you cant even play your fav song over and over why did you removed that in the app idk whos idea to put random songs in your playlist who ever thought of that is a horrible idea,negative
had to uninstall and reinstall for the second time due to years-old bug triggered by app updates when spotify set to offline mode. cannot login unless i do this.,negative
really great app i got what am paying for couldn't be happier ðÿ˜š,positive
why pay for premium if there's still going to be ads every 7 minutes? is there something more i have to do to turn the ads off??,negative
super sound quality,positive
"it's great n all but it has an issue when i'm using it,it only has the logo and it won't open i hope you guys fix this.ðÿ˜",negative
"the app has been getting more and more buggy and even with a subscription, i get pop-ups advertising in-app podcasts i have no desire to listen to.",negative
"every couple of months the app's 'fun' side rears it's ugly head. i'm talking the sound cutting out for no reason till you open the app again, downloaded files that are in the downloads folder not playing till you're back on wifi or turn your data back on and the app not showing on your device that anything is playing when it clearly is. as we speak, spotify started playing again randomly after cutting out for 10 minutes. thanks spotify.",negative

it really good but entire it was ðÿ‘ž good because it didn't have the song on everyone time,positive
"i've been having issues connecting with remote play, my phone doesn't allow me to play songs directly from my favorite/hearted songs. edit: this has been an issue for almost a year.. half the time i can't play music unless i click the shuffle button, it doesn't let me select individual songs. not sure what i'm paying for at this rate. tested on two pixels and a moto.. edit 2: still broken two months later, collectively over a year. should i just give up??",negative
"don't like the advertisements so much. lately they've been getting lengthy with sometimes 5 in a row, which throws a wrench in my workout.",positive
every songs are here best app like instagram and also bts songs are here each and every,positive
could do better at loading when in offline mode since it's all already downloaded,negative
love spotify.. my music go to..,positive
very easy to use. updated gebra of music.,positive
this is very good app to listen song and sing with that by reading lyrics.,positive
it is alright but as soon as the premium runs out it sucks because if you try to play a song you searched up you just get some other song instead of what you clicked on so basically you have to pay to listen to the music that you want also it now sometimes refuses to give me my six skips per hour because i used it yesterday and today used three skips and it said that i have used my six skips also not to mention it now gives me almost three ads in one ad and the thirty minutes don't work anymore,negative
super super it's all no words better than these app *gana app *hangama * jio savan great work from spotify .,negative
"poor...30 seconds ads never felt like they last a long time till now. especially when you're just trying to play music. i get that they need money...but bro...right in the middle of the playlist? what's the point of listening your favorite song if an ads ruins your mood, hype and vybe just because you don't have premium.",negative
this app is a nice app for music and podcast and there are my favourite artist,positive
i cant open the app : ( tried installing-uninstalling the app multiple times already... still not responding,negative
new update... why shuffle play button dissappear in liked songs? i want to get random music. there is only play/stop button and second button to loop playing. please return it back!,negative
best app for podcasts ....best suggestion.but the ads are annoying so spotify make sure you reduce the amount of ads,negative
"love it!!! nothing else to say that would be better than ""love it!!!""",positive
"after this last update the app won't even open ok my phone, it's just stuck on the loading screen",negative
"i loved spotify, but the most recent update makes it where i can't pick what song is playing, and it just plays randomly and never plays music on my playlist anymore, if this is the new spotify, i will be deleting spotify and use something else, now i also can't see what is even on my playlist anymore, it just has a list and not a playlist",negative
tired of your ads ðÿ˜‘ uninstalling itðÿ˜‘,negative
fantastic for music lovers.. on point!,positive
"y'all should add some features that will make the app incredible. one, add a feature that can allow users to play all offline songs. two, add a supermix. and three, add two tabs on the home page that will say ""music"" and ""podcast"" it's time to separate music from podcast. also, make it easy to download podcast episodes. i want to enjoy a podcast show without any pausing(buffering). maybe auto download.",positive

"app always going off lately! very annoying. i thought i was the only one, but reading reviews here, many facing same issue.",negative
keeps crashing when i open it.,positive
it's a great app but you can't really choose the song you want to play and if you run out of so g that your playlist randomized it just gives you random song that you might not even like and then pretty much forces you to buy premium,negative
so i was using spotify for the last two years and now am having some issues. whenever i get a message notification from whatsapp then notification beep sound continues. no matter what i try the beep sound continues. i don't know whether it's happening because my phone have some bugs or spotify having some issues. need an explanation if it's possible.,negative

"no mather what i do, it will keep playing. i close and it playes again.. damn stupid app...",negative
goood all search enjoy songs,positive
"ðÿª¶.... spotify is the absolute best music and podcast app ever, i couldn't live without it now... soooo much better than youtube the fact one can play a podcast in the background whilst doing other things on my handheld device makes it an absolute cut above the rest & the amount of free quality entertainment is mind blowing..thank you spotify xoxo",positive
great app and amazing wide variety of content. ads are not too loud or frequent in free use. price of premium is very fair and totally worth it!,positive
i think this app is great though the only thing i wish that it has was the loop the song forever although i think it is a premium function and it is alright i think it is a 4.5 around there. definitely better than youtube music in all other parts though especially the ads experiece wow you can listen to a whole hour of spotify and hardly any advertisements would pop out,positive

"7.5.22 app has been glitchy the last few days. podcasts stop every 10 minutes. no control buttons, can't pause or back up. normally this is fixed in short order but it's been too long. i mostly like this app. one ask i have is to make autoplay settings separate for podcasts. depending on where i am when i select an episode, a new one may or may not autoplay at the end. i want autoplay for music but not for podcasts... please and thank you! also shuffle available from the top of all playlists?",negative
i like this app cause i can hear every song,positive
the daily mix is the same music every day nothing new. don't now wy they mix it every day with the same music.,negative
it's an absolute cheating against those people who don't buy spotify premium... because there are 3 long nasty ads after each and every song... i'll delete my account if you don't reduce those long ads after every song...,negative
it's audio is really clear as well as there is smooth transition between 2 songs and it recommends music with careful consideration. great for listening offline,positive

"too many ads,not playing the correct song that i choose.",negative
love it. getting all my favorites.,positive
"randomly skips my songs, won't let me pick specific songs in my playlist, literally missing basic functions you can find in 99% of other music players if you don't buy premium, they want to make it as mind numbing and painful to use their app as possible so you can give them money for something that others can give you for free! atleast with youtube i can pick songs from my playlist to play without skipping through my playlist with shuffle.",negative

"love it been using it for a while, the liked song play list is awesome though i massively wish there'd be a 'relaxing' genre tab for sorting if it does that in the future i'll easily give it 10 stars",positive
poor user interface. you have to wait >10s for albums to load even when offline. why does the app keep trying to connect when in offline mode and phone airplane mode??,negative

"spotify has gotten extremely buggy in the last year or so. i will sometimes get redirected to a playlist radio when i try to shuffle play a playlist, and once in a while it pauses what i'm listening to and the now playing bar in the app and the control widget on my notification screen disappear. i've been a premium member for years and hope these problems get fixed soon, but it looks like they've been known issues for a while.",negative

"extremely infuriating, i pay for premium and spotify wont even let me play the songs in my playlist without playing a random ""recommended"" one, and there is no solution for this, and if there is they have done an incredible job of making the ui as confusing, cluttered and unnavigatable as possible. unsubscribed, am now using a competitor, which is a lot better, for free.",negative

excellent selection of music and user friendly,positive
"i really like spotify,much better than other music apps.",positive
no obvious way to close the app. it seems to want to run in the background all the time. not sure why i would want that feature? uninstalled.,negative
app stopped working on pixel 6 with latest update. force closes instantly.,negative
"it's been a month of waiting, i'm still looking at my screen a logo of spotify how nice isn't.",negative
what happened? since july 4th the app won't work on my phone. it keeps stopping or shutting off completely and it won't play in the background. i used this app for sleeping and can't. there is also no way to skip or relisten to anything. please fix! we pay premium and don't want to find another app for music and podcasts.,negative
we can pick make our fave playlist,positive
my play/pause options have disappeared. this is very annoying! plus the app starts playing on my phone when i turn the car off. which i can't stop because i don't have the control bar. loved the app before this happened.,negative
"fix the shuffle ""always on issue"" i'm a paid member and doesn't even give me an option to unselect shuffle anymore. frustrating doesn't even describe it.",negative
i can't open the app it only displays the logo. i tried clearing the data and cache but still doesn't work.,negative
"it's extremely annoying that i need an internet connection to view my ""downloaded"" content. that tells me that it isn't truly downloaded. in addition, the app will suddenly show that nothing is downloaded, and content is simply listed in my ""episodes."" later, even though i haven't done anything and wasn't near wifi, it will show my content as ""downloaded"" again. shouldn't the app actually download my selections to my phone?",negative
"it's good that you can use it for free and listen to playlists, also podcasts that you're into. the two issues i have are that sometimes (most times), i can't listen to the podcasts i've downloaded offline. then the other is that you can't start a playlist from the beginning, a lot of the time you have to continue the playlist. i used to start another playlist then back again to start it from top but that has not worked in a while.",negative
makes me fall in love with music again!,positive
i really love to hear music on spotify ðÿ˜˜ðÿ˜˜,positive
"after this last update, my app keeps opening and crashing. i tried uninstalling and reinstalling but to no avail did that work. such a shame because this would have been a 4 star review. i hope they fix this issue soon",negative
great app to listening to all kinds of music without having to use yt and kill bandwidth,positive
"i used to really love this app, so i ended up going premium. however, for a few months now there has been countless problems. music or podcasts constantly pausing, the bar where you can skip or pause constantly disappearing. i've contacted spotify and done everything they've asked, but nothing works. i think they need to admit there is a problem with the app that needs fixing.",negative
i've been using spotify for quite some time already. and in general it's cool. but recently i started experience problems with playing songs and podcasts in offline mode. and in general i have an impression that app became more laggy. hope this is temporary.,negative
i always find the music that i'm looking for.,positive
best music streaming app for free,negative
it's nice i can listen to my music,positive
bangla & hindi songs collection is so poor! increase more songs.... ðÿž§,negative

"security issue. the accounta are not secure, avoid signing in with your email service if you cannot avoid using the app. have been using it for almost a year to discover this. your login information is not secure. apart from that.. app is not upto the standard. bells and whistles but no quality. low quality customer support for a paid service. the audio is very low quality, also the support executives have zero clue about their own product.",negative
it's got all the song that i like,positive

"what is this i open the app but the app not start i try all time i check my mobile network, then i use wifi network then i reboot my phone, but the app not start. if the app not work i uninstall the app and i say all don't download the app.",negative
so i have the family pack which allows up to 6 devices and when i go to download my play list it says to many devices ( we only use 4) so i log everyone out and still same problem fix it now or loose a long time subscriber,negative
"has lyrics, integrates better with chromecast than the google music service - seamlessly changing from computer to phone to tv, even automatically when i put my earbuds in. i am amazed how well this works. 11/10, it's the little things that matter and it's clear the people making this care",positive
"app won't go to log in screen, just shows splash screen",negative
gave it 3 stars coz it says listen to no add songs for 30 mins and after every song it is showing me an add please correct it or should i find another app ?ðÿ˜‘ðÿ˜‘ðÿ˜¡ i heard about karaoke mode when is it gonna come hmm??,negative
"break comes again and again, the mind is bad, that's why i am deleting this app, bad app is bad",negative
"it won't let me past the opening screen with the logo i tried re installing, clear data/cache, force stop , restarting device nothing seems to work plus i don't get canvas feature so i'm gonna cancel premium",negative
"love this app been premium for like 2-3 years, but now i can't go into home (like first page when u enter) and would be cool if that is fixed",negative
"now it stops when you open another app. music keep randomly stopping this is on a playlist i have downloaded, also app keeps crashing again. i cancelled my premium because of the problems before. i can't see me keeping it as not much has changed, always problems",negative
"usually love this app and works fine on my phone but on my laptop its a mess. it closes down within seconds of opening it, and doesn't want to work. sadly its only the spotify desktop app which is giving me problems, i hope they check if there are some bugs soon :) other than that love the app",negative
"i dont listen to music alot but spotify is pretty solid, but im still waiting for that one karaoke feature i saw on tiktok i dont know if thats real or not but ive already updated my spotify so yeah",positive
latest update is rubbish. the app is not even working atm. first on my car ay. now not on android phone at all. trying to reinstall the app. get you stuff together i pay for a working app. not this,negative
"constamtly randomly pauses, or doesn't let you press play at all. terrible for a paid for service",negative
worst app i ever seen too much problems. my recommendation please do not download this app..,negative
first of all i had to make a new account because it wasn't giving the option for mobile login. then now when i play a song on shuffle or normally after every skip it reaches the first song i played and it's frustrating seriously,negative
the best music app that i have used so far,positive
"pls fix the bug i can't open spotify since yesterday 07/4/2022, pls i can't open spotify not gonna lie i can't pls help me or fix it, thank you.",negative
sound is. so clear. easy to use.,positive
"so far so good, i am loving the app. it makes collecting my playlists easy",positive
"finally spotify have put in lyrics if available, such a long time.",negative
good ui but too much ads. mostly cringe ads.,negative
had all my music saved to my sd card yet when spotify updated i lost everything and it won't let me go back to sd card as it keeps trying to download to the phone. there is no problem with my sd card so i blame spotify for stressing me out unable to use app now offline,negative
"very easy to use, thanks ðÿ˜š",positive
the song which i want to listen is not played.for example i want to play lut gaye from jubin nautiyal.other song is played but not lut gaye.very sad.,negative
amazing i would say i'm not premium member but i didn't give it full 5 star because sometimes the ads are quite often to the point that there would ads after every song and other is that sometimes it just stops working it doesn't show me which song i'm playing so they fixed that i would rate it 5 star without being a premium member,negative
for those who are tired of the ads provide by spotify. just simply download spotify from happy mod it's 100% safe and secure and it's exactly the same as the original version you will never get ads and you can also download your favourite songs ðÿ‘š[thank me later â˜ºï¸],positive
"new update sucks, i hate the add to queue option when i press on a song. just play the darn thing",negative
"so many problems with player, randomly stops, often doesn't show player etc",negative
great music listening experience. would love an option to identify a song playing in the background.,negative
i hate it because when i play a song i couldn't hear anything and if i download a song it keeps kicking me out of the app,negative
it's a really nice app. has almost all the songs which one could ever dream of. the only problem is too many ads. if maybe u could somehow reduce the amounts of ads for free listeners then that'll be great.ðÿ‘,positive
option of being able to just hide specific recommendation is just gone?!,negative
"app stuck on load screen, even after multiple uninstalls.",negative
"extremely good quality music which gives justice to every music, whether it be jazz, rock, pop, classic etc and also dj mixes. very good correspondence",positive
love spotify cause i'm able to make my music list and share it with my friends,positive
too much of adsðÿ‘ž,negative
welcome to the ad app,positive
too much ads,negative
if there is power cut and when light comes and you try to play some music it say no network connection,negative
it's good app cx it has no adds and we can make our own playlists as well it's pretty fun,positive
well organised app but reason for 2 stars are 1.) lots of ads after every 2 songs there's an ad 2.) connected to wifi with avg speed of 10mbps still there's a network error so i have to close app and open again 2-3 times to try my luck,negative
for real bro... 6 skips an hour. were putting limits on skips now how money hungry can you get,negative
very nice to listen to music,positive
horrible when you click on a song it doesn't play that song it plays a playlist and too make matter worse you can't even play specific songs on a playlist you created,negative
"stupid app, borderline greedy. forces use to use premium, or else you almost couldn't even listen to your album. why the auto shuffle? no one needed that thing",negative
"i listen to it when i going to sleep, when im exersizin, and even when im playing games with myself.",positive
"can't really complain , except that sometimes it just stops playing music... this is honestly very irritating , i'm assuming it does this , because i don't a subscription but all in all , i highly recommend it , good quality music edit : i canceled my subscription 2 months ago because i couldn't deal with the double deductions every month. they still deduct money from my account and they are refusing to refund me my money. if you know what's good for you, you will download apple music.",positive
it's a good app but the ads are just annoying and i don't know why we get 6 skips per hour like why not just remove the feature and sometimes i'll be in a sad mood and then an ad will come on and will ruin the vibe and and then another add will come on but look it's a very good app but just lower the ads and remove the 6 skips per hour thing please?!?!,negative
"since the new update, the ""now playing"" tab keeps disappearing and i can't even pause or click next track. after a while, the track stops. i have tried uninstall and install it again, but it keeps happening. pls fix the bug, it's annoying.",negative
"the experience could be improved for offline mode. if i start playing a playlist that i downloaded already online, i'm unable to just continue playing it if i go offline. i must replay it from scratch, which is a problem if i was playing in shuffle mode. please improve on that. also, if a spotify playlist is updated by just reshuffling tracks, songs don't need to be downloaded again if they've already been downloaded. please find a way to just rearrange without downloading again.",negative
it helps me calm down and helps me play games longer,positive
great sound tracks.,positive
it is has amazing options. but it always have problems with loading. it always shows (no internet connection available). while all other apps work absolutely fine in my current network connection.,negative
"spotify is really no. 1 music app because i found it everywhere like windows, macbook, webos tv, android and many more. i really loved it â™¥ï¸ and quality is also 1st class",positive
can listen to all my play lists and more,positive
"listen,spotify is a great app, i've been using it for over 3 years,the people on here say 'it plays random songs not from my playlist' usually that is with a normal subscribtion. i highly recommend getting premium,if i'm not mistaken a family package is around r99pm.it is amazing and i really enjoy spotify and their music!",positive
lately the app doeasn't show itself and i can't control it like pause or play or close it. sometimes i restart the phone itself!,negative
everything great other than the equalizer menu should be accessible on the homepage snd the app has some bad optimization or something because it opens super slow.,negative
a dreamy app to experience your life with more beats & melodies whenever you want... just adds are intruption and remindes me how poor i am.... ðÿ˜…,negative
i don't like how it's not working how it use to but it's an amazing app it's just i want to listen to a different song when a song is playing but it plays 10 seconds of the song i want to listen to,positive
just keep stopping for no reason. have to force close to get it working again. ðÿ¤¦â€â™‚ï¸ðÿ¤¦â€â™‚ï¸ðÿ¤¦â€â™‚ï¸,negative
"too many adds and more emphasis on buying premium , podcast don't have adds soo good",negative
this app best from all music apps excellent app forever,positive
"back then, this app was good and smooth. i've noticed some upsetting developments in the last several days. when i start opening my spotify app, all i have seen is the logo. it's crashing and freezing at the same time. i've still thought of trying those tutorials on youtube, but many of them didn't work. so i'm expecting that this concern of mine will be fixed immediately.",negative
amazing i took of my phone expecting to come off like other apps but it did not i'm impressed if u love playing games while listening to music like me i really say download this app truely amazing,positive

8/10 i don't mind ads but certain ads are annoying,negative
the waste app i have seen .30 min per 1 add they will say but 2 songs per one add . the waste and lie app i have seen .,negative
"overall, the app is really good. knocking a star for the regular harassment to upgrade to a family account from the dual. enough already!",positive
love it #1 in my book. been a customer for over 4 years,positive
if only all the songs i downloaded could appear on a single page,negative
so much add . and i don't have any interst of premium . please stop,negative
"best app for music and new discoveries. the a.i. recommendations to similar artists/albums, is second to none, a must though is membership. but worth every penny if you are a fellow music fan. would give 100 stars if i could; spotify has re-ignited my passion in listening to good, new (and old) music.",positive
it offers good quality and you can also find incredible play lists in this.,positive
"used to be my favorite music apps but after log out, i can't open the apps in my phone",negative

"i loved the app and listening to music for a while, but now the mobile app wont even fully load. whenever i try to open to app, it stays on the icon screen forever. i've tried uninstalling and reinstalling, clearing data, clearing cache, restarting my phone, restarting my networks, but nothing is working for me.",negative
i am happy by listening songs with spotify,positive
"the apps keeps crashing anytime i try to make a playlist, and even then i can't listen to a single song or podcast because ""my internet connection is not responding"" or something, it says as i play youtube videos just fine. even created playlist appear to be empty. every. single. one. if i try to make a playlist and it doesn't crash for some damn miracle as much as i add songs the playlist it stays empty... and i really wanted to use this app, fix it or lose my money.",negative
"avoid this app!!! you are better off listening to song on youtube. i uninstalled it 2 hours after i installed it. you can search for a song but when you try to play it spotify decides you really should listen to another. i searched for should have been a cowboy, song not album. i hit the play button and what comes out of my phone? bubby shot the jukebox. ok, i must have done something wrong so i do it again. i never did get this steaming pile of fecal matter to play it get correct song.",negative
"can't even start the app, i have to use spotify lite",negative
it worked and now it doesn't at all i pay spotify premium just for it not to work,negative
there are the songs which you can't even find in youtube...one of the best music listening app ever,positive
"toooooo many ads....its irritating.an ad between 2 songs...worst uh.. other than ads u can find all the songs, playlists... i'm gonna uninstall it due to ads ðÿ˜’",negative
"i love this app so much to be honest, tho paying 10$ for premium is a bit much and when i turn off my phone to listen to it same will the music sometimes but all and all i love this app so much its really great! :)",positive
spotify is the best app to listen to music!! ðÿ¤©ðÿ¤© but sometimes i'm always indecisive on the song i should listen to ðÿ˜¹ðÿ˜¹,positive
"for me, at one point it would just not load. for example, the spotify symbol would just stay on the screen frozen, not doing anything until i just gave up on it.",negative
alot of ads,negative
this app used to be great but in like the past year it's gotten to where it doesn't load. even songs that are downloaded won't load if you don't have internet connection. i don't understand why i'm paying such a high fee n can't have my music and podcast,negative
"been running into a bunch of bugs recently. the most annoying is that i can't add more than one thing to the queue. if i keep adding, it will just erase the previous addition and i have to restart my phone several times to get it to work. every now and then the control bar will disappear so i can't pause whatever i'm listening to even if i try from my headphones. not to mention the random freezing and shutting down that has been more frequent lately. i've reported it before, never heard back",negative
i like the feature that has lyrics but it'd be nice to have the option available to cast the lyrics to the same device i'm listening on.,negative
i love the songs it has diffrent langigesit. its... perslfect,negative
the user experience and ui of the mobile app is awful. lots of missing features and functions such as sorting playlists are just hidden behind menu's and menu's and it's a very bad experience when compared to the desktop version.,negative
"not sure what happened but for 2 days now, my mobile spotify app hasn't been working. it's showing my playlists on the home page, but not in my library. whenever i click on a playlist, it shows zero songs, so i can't play music on my phone at all. fix this please!!!!",negative
app gets stuck on the logo screen,negative
you can find all your music favorites....and still doing it thanks,positive
"i really enjoy this app and kindly i be searching songs, that i have never listened for a long long timeâ¤ thanks to this app niether it depletes to much data cost, but thanksðÿ˜ðÿ¤™ðÿ»",positive
easy interface....personalised playlists...superb sound quality.,positive
i think it's a good way to wake up listening to something instead of a clock going off every morning. and it helps connect with family and friends also helps u get in a good mood or if u wanna sing with someone this is the number one app i recommend.,positive
the app it's self isn't that bad great selection of music but the algorithm for shuffle is horrible.,negative
"it's an absolutely great app for listening to music, but only if you have time. this app is unreal if you don't have to wait for music, but if you have low service and a want to play your already downloaded music you're sol, you're going to have to wait for service to play the music downloaded on your phone. this also applys if you're a service member without service overseas. you wont have access to your already downloaded to your phone music at all.",negative
years in and i still love it. never a problem. so much easier than any other app. love my music and they deliver. thank you..,positive
they just removed a latest marathi film songs album which i was frequently listening these days. the claim of 30 min music without ads after a long ad is not right.,negative
5 stars spotify your the goat for fixing it lots of love. never gonna stop using spotify my goto music sorce!!! 100/100,positive
good apps i wanna give 5 star but using this app longer and longer the ads come every 2 song after and says 30 min uninterrupted ads but when we play 3 song or more ads come again. some song are unable to play. last point when entering playlist it took time but when we turn off our net and enter the playlist it's fast... wts does it mean?? plzz fixed it,negative
"rarely have i looked for anything - rare, live, obscure...- that i can't find.",negative
very greatful app for song.. and also i request to you please add one feature also to identify any songs.. especially it is very helpful to identity edited ringtone amd songs... because i think some people's are knowing nice music and songs through the 1 minute or 30 second edited status video from the whatsapp.. instagram etc... i hope you try to add a feature to identity musics&songs .. really iam still enjoying your apps,positive
i cant open this years wrapped before the app crashing two seconds into the first slide. please fix this,negative
"it's a good app for music, but there's a lot of ads and you can't skip more than six songs.",positive
there appears to be more and more bugs happening every day. it's a shame the overall rating doesn't fully capture the current experience using the mobile app. every issue i'm experiencing i can find in other users ratings.,negative
"i really love it bcz i love songs to and listening a story horror story, funny story, sad story, romantic story, that u can listen in spotify you can listen any songs and story and u will enjoy it i promise",positive
"since my spotify got premium, my spotify was like possessed by a demon, it changed the song by itself, turns up the volume by itself, and annoys me by opening other pop up screens when i am typing, just like a cellphone screen that gets hit by water. it is not worth it at all.",negative
this is a excellent music app to listen to.,positive
ever time i played a song it would ether play a song that won't stop playing unless i restart my phone or it would pause at random times!,positive
"the moment i paid for premium, the app ain't starting and getting hanged. wasn't expecting this action from spotify.",negative
"the app doesn't load in my phone, but liter version of it does and any other music player",negative
in the beginning spotify was good but now it is the worst i can't skip music when i search for a song it gives me a playlist wih the same name and it doesn't even contain the song i want and songs are not full when i play a song it gives a very very short part of it uh and honestly sound cloud â˜ï¸ is better ðÿ˜œ,negative
why the hell does this new update keep making my music pause like every 20 seconds. its very annoying!! i do not pay premium every month for this. please fix bug!!,negative
"i stopped subscribing because you had podcaster that ia an anti vaxxer spreading disinformation. if he is gone , i will come back.",negative
it's a pretty good app but i hate the update.,negative
definitely the best. recommended for many more music lovers.,positive
"love this app. whatever mood i am in, spotify can satisfy my music craving. i just wish i knew how to stop my notifications from interrupting my songs.",negative
"love this app, i only use this for my music streaming. i pay for premium for my family and both my mom and i have been experiencing weird pauses and skips. for example, sometimes when i let my phone screen time out while playing music and it goes dark it pauses, sometimes it will come back on its own and other times i have to restart the app. it pauses other times too. it's a minor inconvenience but very annoying.",negative
loving spotify since 2015,positive
"you're always updating. stop. get it to where it works and don't touch it. every time you guys update the are problems... or maybe, i don't know, do it right. app is stopping again for no reason. and no, i don't want to uninstall and download all my music again.",negative
the volume of music when using earphones is low but when the ads pop it will blow my ears and it has 2-3 ads in a row what waste of time i could just open my youtube app.,negative
this app doesn't let your critique anything; whether it be like racist or single minded podcasts like behind the bastards or necronomipod. i find it quite humorous that such a large business could be so reckless when so many of their podcast creators destroy lives without little to any evidence.,negative
"i can still access my playlists and play songs on the web browser, but through the mobile app, i cannot",negative
"love spotify so much, only reason it doesn't have five stars is because there are so many ads. but, great quality and i love how i can find any song on here!!! <3",positive
it works perfectly fine before but starting yesterday it won't get pass the spotify logo sign for minutes then it would freeze and exit on its own. i'm missing my playlists already so please fix it!,negative
usually i use use spotify daily but recently there's been a glitch and it just shows the logo when i open it and it doesn't work. i've tried doing things to my device to try and help it but nothings working.,negative
i enjoy a mix of music with limited adds,positive
"for some reason still no access to lyrics unless i make a new account, which makes zero sense...",negative
great app. sometimes glitches and the controls don't work so i have to keep listening without skipping songs. normally good though.,negative
"the new update sucks a fat one!! pauses randomly, the player disappears and i can't pause/stop the music. edit: after a couple of months, updates, re-installs, these issues are still happening. very disappinting considering i have a pretty new high-powered samsung galaxy.",negative
"jesus this is frustrating. even though i force close this app several times, it immediately opens in my car and i can't get it to not connect. it is ridiculously frustrating. borderline useless. i hope the engineers that worked on this get diarrhea and a cough for a week.",negative
i like it but the new update is trash and is makes me want to get rid of it please fix it,negative
"i mean i used to love spotify but now it literally plays an ad after every song. not only this but it constantly exits the app and stops playing a song for no reason. it also skips songs on its own. it also plays those ads that supposedly gives you 30mins of ad free music if i watch it and when i do watch it, it starts playing ad after ad and it's annoying. i get you need to pay artists but the amount of ads played is ridiculous. had to move to apple music, can't use spotify no more.",negative
"come on, its spotify, its the best music app out there",positive
excellent listening experience. you can listen to music with the screen off.,positive
like the play lists they set up for me based on the music i like.,negative
it's too good. all the songs i can ask for are available at one platform. i am loving it.,positive
easy to use easy to enjoy with my devices!,positive
it's good but im begging yall to show what playlists a song are in. like for example after you click 'add to playlist' maybe have a mark next to the playlist name if the song is already in the playlist. it would make organizing so much easier and less time consuming please add it ðÿ˜­ðÿ˜­,negative
it's pretty good one day i'll pay the fee but not today lol,positive
"spotify suddenly logged out my acc out of nowhere and they wouldn't let me log in. it always says, ""something went wrong, try to use your emial instead"" but whenever i try to use my email, it always says ""there's no user found in this email"" it's frustrating!!!! i just want my acc back???!?!?!???",negative
it's a good app but when i tried to play my own playlist i made it just starts playing random songs that i don't even like spotify if you can make it an option to make it were the only songs in there are the ones we pick and not some random songs,negative
spotify is one of the best choices for music that i can think of. i had premium for a year and that was really great cause i was able to make-up some fantastic playlists. and they don't erase them when you go back to free.,positive
love it lots of great music choices,positive
i'm not able to open spotify,negative
definitely a great music an podcast app. easy to navigate thru the app.,positive
i absolutely love spotify!!!,positive
i hate how it adds more songs to a single song and you just wanted to listen to that one song and it adds songs to your playlists too.also why can't you remove songs?,positive
"love this app. wish i could work for spotify, bet it's a real blast. ðÿ˜œ the only issue i have is the ads. can't afford to go premium just yet !",negative
i love that i can see all my favorites and much more,positive
bro when i connect my alex to my phone click on a song it just doesn't play that song even when i am not connected to my alex very bad aap,negative
used to be great but now is not. when apps misfunctions one must delete all content to reset. no customer support exists-- just advice from other users. so to get the value of my premium subscription i must uninstall to re-install dumping my 1k song library ðÿ˜žðÿ˜“ðÿ˜© 07/22 no change. review remains valid,negative
please if you would provide us with a video player it would be fantastic,positive
great music love this app,positive
"5 stars, for the most of the times. car mode could improve. some songs are not there, but all in all... it rocks ðÿ˜š",positive
need to add option to redeem spotify card from app itself .currently i only see a credit card and paypal options .guess you guys dont seems to care .please add that option to the app or me personally i'm done .it shouldn't be hard to add that option to the app.,negative
constantly crashes on my pixel 6. has so many bugs where it plays music but i can't pause or stop it.,positive
"i love this app, it gives the listener a high quality of sound and it has great catalogue of music which caters for everyone's tastes. the plus with spotify pro you get the added bonus of no ads and get to download whatever song or album you like. spotify also grows with you, it keeps track of all your music likes and spotify gives you a more tailor-made experience. 10/10 ' love it.'",positive
"great music app, however some great songs are unavailable. i know this may be out of the companies control but it does suck whenever i want to listen to a song only to find it is unavailable.",negative
now ads bad app,negative
great can use a little work,positive
nothing else needs to be said... finding artist i am looking for!,negative
great music selection easy interaction with app. overall amazing expetience and premium with no ads...just great!,positive
often times its deleting my dowloaded music even if im premium,negative
"lot of bugs, one of them is when you remove (-) a song and press next(>) in playlist--- it skips next two songs and plays",negative
very good app but i know they want to have money but it is somewhat frustrating to wait 1 hour just to change the song if you have changed it 6 times besides you can't choose because you have to be premium for not having to listen to other songs and only listen to the one you want,negative
"it's an amazing app it's the only music app i use other than youtube. the only thing is sometimes the ad that gives you 30 mins uninterrupted listening bugs, but it's no big deal",negative
has anybody experienced the mike rowe's podcast freezing and not playing at all?.,negative
reliable and loaded with the music i like,positive
"excellent choices and variety, a go to for any music enthusiasts",positive
"even without premium i can still enjoy my music, it's a very very nice and enjoyable app.",positive
"i really love spotify, but i recently moved to apple music because of payment issues. i wish you guys will support google pay for payments.",negative
"i still have spotify, and the songs are great, but the reason i'm giving it 2 stars is because there wasn't very many ads before, and now there are several. i get the same ads over and over and over. i'm sick of it! and now spotify had decided to give me the exact same ad twice in a row. like, seriously?! i don't want premium. i'm not paying $15.00 for that bullsh*t. fix. this. now. i'm literally currently trying to find a different app to listen to music on, but so far nothing good. fix it! ðÿ˜ ",negative
wonderful music...all my favorites that i haven't heard in years,positive
"everytime i save my music to the sd card, the app decides to reset the default storage to local storage. this has happened 3 times now. i hate having to redownload everything again. it's heavily inconvenient. fix this please. otherwise it's a great app",negative
"very comprehensive catalogue of music. the one thing that would improve the experience would be the ability to ""insert"" songs into playlists at a specific point rather than having to delete/remove songs and start again.",positive
brilliant in every way. 11/10,positive
"gapless playback doesn't work between end and beginning of albums, it ruins the experience of certain albums, especially nonagon infinity which is meant to infinity loop. otherwise it's perfect. also really good for learning lyrics to songs.",positive
"spotify is currently useless, i can't pay for premium anymore. its like they don't want my money anymore",negative
"great music on spotify,would recommend.",positive
i think it sucks we have to pay for no ads but other than that i love it :),positive
spotify is a very good music app just one thing about it if you have a google display it won't let you play all the music you have to actually go on the app to hear the song i hate this i don't know if it is because of google or spotify and i don't know if this happens on alexa but besides that it's a good music app for you to get,positive
"found out a lot of new music & artists over years thanks to the ""radio"" feature. very nice algorithm, even though my taste is very wide (: one thing spotify should improve (that bothers me daily & would also be very easy to perform in my opinion) - enable ticking boxes so that we'd be able to add songs to multiple playlists at once, without the drag of having to press the ""more"" (3 dots) option over and over again!",positive
look they asked nicely and i decided to rate it 5 stars it's really good,positive
in the 70's you had to flip the lp after every 5 songs! then 80's cd's were... eject and insert the next cd. we've come along way baby!,negative
good quality sound best online ..but thank you spotify by free share with friend....,positive
i love spotify i get all the music i enjoy and even more i may have forgotten about in one place.,negative
the app logged me out for no reason then deleted all of my downloads after sending me a forgot password link that never worked and when i did get in it logged me out immediately when i went out of the app. i had wi-fi the whole time as well,negative
"i used to love this app, i was happy with the certain skips a hour but now three adverts before one song and worst part is, it is not even music from my playlist being played. i have certain playlists for each activity i'm doing or who ever is using my account and i don't like how when listening to my playlist, songs that aren't added start playing.",negative
absolutely ultimate music customized just for you. 15 year member,positive
don't ask me i reaubscibed and now the plan i originally had i didn't pick this individual plan i had the share plan and all the music saved is no longer and also save nothing created 3 playlists sat the past 30 mins adding music not one song saved ? what's the deal,negative
please enable the capability of clicking on music labels within the credits.,positive
good music and i love this app,positive
"update: loads slower than molasses lately! ðÿ™„ spotify is my ""goto"" music app!!!! i don't pay for the premium, i know! i do, however, feel leary about some of the security of the app and how it seems to have different music for 'suggestions' that are not relevant to me in anyway?? sometimes, it even shows i've listened/watched things i haven't! with that being said, customer support could step up their game a smidge if possible for attending to inquires when emailed! overall, ðÿ’•it!",negative
great app got all my favorite songs love the premium not happy about the price going up but whatever.,positive
best choice of music.,positive
it was great but now on this new phone the app doesn't pop-up on the lock screen or the notification panel it doesn't show a preview of the current song,negative
i love spotify but sometimes annoying when i can't find a song i like lol. hardly ever happens,negative
"device limit reach reached. unable to download songs, no option to remove other devices, zero transparency on device count, 'sign out everywhere' does nothing and i have reached out to support. spotify is awesome but this sucks. show me my devices or let me remove them. don't count old devices that have been offline for a year or more. spotify apparently wants to burn money having this handled by their tech support department instead of providing an easy method for end-users.",negative
"love it,opens so many doors wow!!",positive
because of so much ads,negative
free awesome at least with ads it is free,positive
"awesome, thank you so much for the service.",positive
the only music streaming app i use. 5/5,negative
"i love this app! great selection, great variety and very few advertisements. wow i just can't say enough good things without being corny! !;-)",positive
"probably the best music streaming app i ever used till now. it has so many features like - 1. you can make blends with your friends. spotify can create a blend for 10 people ( that's a lot ) 2. to be honest, the ads are never too much, unlike some other apps where you get an ad after every 1 song. 3. it can play music in the background. 4. it also automatically starts a song if the song which you chose to play is done playing. conclusion : i highly recommend this app",positive
the app would not let me play my liked songs instead just random now im mad please help,negative
amazing music app ðÿ‘œðÿ»ðÿ‘œðÿ»ðÿ’•,positive
probably the best app for music streaming.,positive
overall good app but to many ads,positive
in love they make music for all the crazy music i listen to they learned i have a happy mix and depressed mix and more that helps so much.. i totally recommend this app for everyone,positive
some songs aren't available why? and there's a bug where i pause my music and the playback goes from 1:45 to 4:45 or even 0.,negative
"it's okay, not great, not terrible, very okay, a bit janky on android, sometimes stops working when i lock my screen, or just stops playing. bit dissapointing for a paid service. the general ui experience is also weak, it'd be cool for a free app made by some stoner kids, but not a premium paid-for music service. also no raspberry pi os (arm64 support is really really quite lame.)",negative
i love this app it is the best app for music in my opinion but i hate how i'm listening to a song it ends and a whole different song pops up not even in my playlist i get it's supposed to get you into new music but it is so annoying i can be listening to my favorite song i cannot wait for this next song i really like here's a song that i've never liked and the artist is not the best otherwise it's pretty good app,positive
i use it daily. i don't catch any problems.,negative
if you want to listen to it and but it gives you 30 minutes of free listening and it will give you six skips just skip this song per hour and go to use them wisely but again a very good app,positive
the worst app i've ever been used . it's had show often same ads and after your mobile network issue the app doesn't support to play a single song.. that's why im1 uninstalling this worst app ...,negative
"has all of my favorite songs!! one thing.... it says ""no internet connection available"" when i try to play a playlist.. even when i do! anyone else having this issue??",negative
the app just isn't playing the music when i cast it to my tv.,negative
very intrusive app that don't respect privacy.,negative
i am giving it 4 stars because it has problem that when i play music from my playlists it doesn't played plz look into this issue. and this app is very good for music . and i am deleting this app until issue resolved,negative
"how about giving the option to listen to elevator music until the darn app open? takes more than a minute to load up, really? it is truly the buggies app on my phone!",negative
not good after recent update. i can't see what song is playing and it pauses at every notification i get,negative
does this app just shut itself off when an update is available idk but it's getting annoying that i have to come back every 2minutes to hit play again!,negative
this app service very fast all song avaliable here good works spotify ðÿ’ÿðÿ’ÿðÿ’ÿðÿ’¯ðÿ’¯ðÿ’¯ðÿ’¥ðÿ’¥â£ï¸â£ï¸,positive
updates always break the app stop updating so often,negative
fix the app. it keeps stopping and won't show on the notification bar.,negative
removing the enhance feature from like songs makes exactly zero sense. wish i could downgrade my version to get the feature again. instead i have to fiddle by creating redundant playlists from my liked songs existing playlist.,negative
"more commercials than music, this is no longer a music app...it's an add app! your own greed will ruin you.",negative
"app not working properly after latest update. no panel at bottom of screen to set sleep timer, and will stop playing after 5 minutes. before this update i would use it every day, but just frustrating now, won't be using until fixed.",negative
i like spotify but i hate that i can't just play my entire library without having to add songs to a playlist or like all songs. can you just create a shuffle button to play all songs in a person's library?,negative
i love this app bts all songs available for spotify ðÿ’œðÿ’œðÿ’œðÿ’œðÿ’œðÿ’œðÿ’œðÿ’œðÿ’œ,positive
very awesome app very easy to use,positive
i like their music without ads on their premium and i like their choices and my choices and it's enjoyable why i cook because i cook for a living and it's stress relieving and the music really helps,positive
"generally fine. not always as intuitive as the developers perhaps assume. also hurry up and make a way to completely disable group sessions. if it's not something you want, the fact that someone in your group can change what you're listening to is very annoying. especially when they don't even realize that they are doing it. see above for the app not always being as intuitive as developers assume",negative
premium user here and can't use the app. it keeps on crashing the plsy/pause bar dissappears i can't play podcasts for longer than 5 minutes. i can't move around my playlists. this has been going on for weeks now. i want my money back.,negative
can't see the bar to skip 15 seconds etc at the bottom of the app or when the app is closed.,negative
the worst app. first my account automatically log out and then all my favourite songs are gone. i update this app but still nothing. and i'm also uninstalling this. ðÿ˜¤ðÿ˜¤ðÿ˜¤ðÿ˜¤ðÿ˜¤,negative
"just got the s22 ultra, and after opening the app, it just shows the logo and doesn't do anything else. i haven't even logged in to my account",negative
"just few words ""the best""",positive
i am getting sick of you guys changing what i am listening to when i press to play my liked playlist and you keep starting to play songs that are not on my liked playlist. i purposely choose to play my liked songs for a reason so stop changing it to play something that is not in my liked playlist. ðÿ˜¡ if i wanted to play random stuff i would say play suggested music but i don't hardly ever do that i just want the music i want to hear which is in my light playlist so stop messing with it. ðÿ˜¡,negative
love that i can pick my own music genre and make my own playlist.,positive
i love being able to close out the app and open other apps and still listen to music,positive
"love it... always have all the music (artists, albums anything u desire) for any type of mood/situation....",positive
after the last update i dont have controls on pausing or seeing whats playing. it just plays and the only way of stopping is to force close the app. samsung user,negative
"the first few days it was a great app where i could listen to music freely, but now i have six skips an hour! and when i go on my playlist it says they added stuff on my playlist! that's my playlist! how are you gonna add songs that i don't even like! the songs that you add are not why i made the playlist! you're just ruining it, i'm going to a diffrent app. this one is just a waste of time, and money for people who use spotify premium",negative
this app is terrible if you want to be able to play your own songs that you own. if you want to radio that you cannot control in any way shape or form it's fine if you want a pod catcher great if you want to be able to actually play your music that you own it gives you a middle finger,negative
"this was an extorinary music app. the biggest thing is whatever we like the song we can like and put it easly in playlist. so, i think is the best app to listening music ðÿ˜ðÿž¶ðÿž¶ðÿžµðÿžµðÿž¶ðÿž¶",positive
sometimes it lags,negative
any music or podcasts anytime anywhere!,negative
great app but i have been having issue like when i playy music the app closes it and when i open the app it won't let me even i tried everything also the 6 skips is too low to be honest especially i have to whatch 5 amount of ads which is ridiculous i hope this get fixed,negative
very nice app for music,positive
awesome to hear music for freeâ˜ºðÿ˜˜,positive
its good but i don't like the fact ive to pay to choose what song i can listin too,negative
i love it! i wish i have money to get the premium hahaha! but spotify is the best music app for me!â™¡,positive
great variety of music.,positive
"i love spotify.. in my opinion spotify is the best music app out there, change my mind. you can't!!!",positive
it's great i love listening to music on it . it works great except the fact that spotify automatically stops working after playing two or three songs . can you help with that?,positive
my playlits are all empty but on my ipad they are all there help me plss,negative
very interesting. easily connect me with my old time music,positive
love it. i use this app every day. if finding radio was easy that would be super.,positive
it was working fine for many months but nowadays i am facing frequent crashes.sometimes the app doesn't work at aal.,negative
"i love the app. i wish we could edit better without premium, because some people cannot buy that, but it doesn't take away from the oppertunities overall. that is, if you can be patient.",positive
too much advertisements..,negative
"what a sad excuse to make me pay for subscription. this app is horrifically hard to use. it's like telling a 2 year old how to do things. you tell the app to play this song, but except it plays something completely different all because ""you didn't pay the subscription.""",negative
"previous issue got fixed, but now it plays a song, but doesn't change interface, so you can pause skip and so on...",negative
very very bad experience it only allows us to hear a particular song repeatedly....only when we have a playlist we could hear our favrt song rather than that it plays the same repeated song and from some particular movie ....it makes me very irritating while hearing the same set of song again again,negative
all i can play are playlist,negative
"i've noticed they use fake artist names on songs they got off of epidemic sound, not cool, they also have record labels using bots to inflate artists views...",negative
i love the way they go straight into the next song like it's being done by a dj,positive
"i have 3 galaxy devices and it's the same over a of them. stops playing constantly; probably about 10 times in a podcast. randomly skips songs after the first 30 seconds. have to reboot ap just to do it all over! thought it was maybe my phone, but the ap is the same across all devices of mine and same complaints from my sister. i've had buggy aps, but i can say this is the least stable app that i have ever used.",negative
best apps and good idea for the first time,positive
spotify the service is great for listening to music but their apps both for mobile and desktop are the absolute worst. i'm honestly thinking about switching to a different service just because of how absolutely terrible their apps are. they're always crashing or freezing and i need to keep restarting. absolute nightmare.,negative
better than youtube having a great meeting better than youtube,positive
love the app mostly of the time. sometimes it glitches and will play songs (just a segment of the song over and . sometimes it'll have two or three songs playing at the same time and i can't figure out how that's happening but for the most part i really like the app,positive
"i love spotifyðÿ™‚ they have every song in the world, love graphics and lyric option",positive
app constantly crashes and now playing screen to pause no longer appears. fix your app. this still continues despite the app being up to date. it's been months how is this still not fixed,negative
music should be uninterrupted and free,positive
everything is great but till rotation,positive
there are too many prblm with the quality of song as of changing quality to very high but still unsatisfied 101% much apk is resso i suggest to continue with resso,negative
"overall the app is pretty nice, but the ads are way too intrusive! sometimes they show up just as soon as i start the app after a few hours of in activity or even first time in a day. this is not normal and user-friendly. maybe give me at least a few tracks to listen, and then play your ads, would you? the ads shouldn't be the 1st thing that i see and hear.",negative
this app is amazing. i like that they provide us new songs even though we are not premium members except the ads. ads are not that frustrating. it comes every 30 mins which is very good. at last i would like to recommend this app for everyoneðÿ‘ðÿ‘,positive
hi since it is the 4th of july can u give all free users a 1 month premium plan because it is the 4th of july and i think it would be very generous of you guys to do that for the month of july!,negative
i love this music and podcast app,positive
i enjoy using spotify but it's extremely difficult to update payment details. i've been trying to do this via the app and web for the last one hour to no avail! check it out asap.,negative
great job...now we can distribute our misic easy,negative
"all of the sudden i don't get sound coming from the left speakers in my car. it only happens when in the car. is this a spotify app issue, car or both? i have a 2020 hyundai tuscon.",negative
"would have loved to give it 5 star. but their payment system in bangladesh is kind of a mess. i've tried local debit cards from 2 banks, none of them worked and their support couldn't gave me a solution. also they should introduce mobile banking/mfs payment like nagad, bkash, rocket, upay etc in bangladesh. they'll get at least 5 times more subscriptions if they introduce mfs payment in bangladesh. i will update the rating to 5 star if they do this.",negative
super duper app.. amazing songs even u have gujarati songs and bhajans too ...that ur competative app doesn't have.. thanks,negative
"since last update, podcasts stop literally every 10 minutes and the display screen is gone so you can't skip forward or back, view queue, add to queue. it's currently unusable.",negative

sometimes even i'm in online i can't search a song. the app says that i'm not in online ðÿ¤·â€â™‚ï¸,negative
just like how easy it is to use,negative
"sound quality is very good, if iam not using app then show adds no issue, but why r u showing adds to take premium, i will never take premium.",negative
"if your looking for reveiws to prove to download this app, download it. but even so, i don't have premium and when i downloaded it, it had 1 ad every 30 minutes (or after i closed it out) but recently, it's been giving me 4 or more ads. it def great with premium tho, my brother has it.",negative
"the shuffle playlist has to be improved. it keeps playing almost the same song over and over again regardless of the huge amount of music i listed in the same playlist; ultimately the reason why i get bored with my favorite songs too quickly. i hope u fix this, cuz i need a shuffle optionâ€”not selective.",negative
nice app song selection is gud,positive
spotify is the best app ever you should try it it doesn't disappoint,positive
can i subscribe to premium via google play? cannot find the options beside visa and paypal.,negative
"giving 2 star because- 1. before the update i could hear my device's local music but now it's disappeared 2. after the update there are too many ads between 2 or 3 songs, it was not there before the update",negative
great music user friendly,positive
"excellent platform for discovering new music, and i've had nothing but good experiences with their support.",positive
very good music app,positive
"i have been using this for a few years now, saves time and gets me everything and more of what i'd like to hear. two thumbs up for this app.",positive
edit: changing my review from 5 star to 2 star. there are tons of fake bot playlists on spotify and there is no way to report them. one of my heavy metal tracks got randomly added to an edm playlist despite not pitching there. extremely fishy. probably trying to tempt me into purchasing streams after i saw the amount of increase in streams. but it just hurts an artists credibility. spotify needs to allow us to report fake playlists. this drama of buying streams needs to end,negative
really great had a good time having a good timereally enjoyed it,positive
i can't figure out what email i am logged in under. it will not allow me to cancel my premium subscription. i'm going to cry. fix your app.,negative

your app performance has fallen apart in the last few weeks. regularly it forces me into offline mode now and doesn't have my full downloaded library despite being connected to working wifi. regularly it fails mid song as well now. sharing music is also not working across the board now. previously everything worked and now it doesn't work well.,negative

"latest update automatically plays music upon opening the app when connected to a bluetooth device??? extremely annoying, please allow an option to disable :(",negative
its amazing i love how i can do whatever i want with my music!! i am speechless! â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸,positive
brilliant app. i use it all the time. the only thing wrong with it is that for phone users the music is stuck on shuffle if you don't have premium. if you removed this it'd make the app better to use. otherwise it's a handy thing to have.,negative
good. it just need better sound quality,negative
"enjoy listening to the songs i love. each time i search for songs to listen to, i find ""new"" songs (oldies, but goodies) to add to my collection. and the ads are short and tolerable.",negative

"found it easy to use , great music selection brilliant ðÿ‘",positive
"i used to love this app a lot... many amazing songs and everything was so perfect... but now it's just like hell. it is reshuffling my songs by its own, adding songs which i don't even listen. i've searched a song almost 20 times and every time it plays different song... please fix it immediately",positive
good songs quality,positive
fabulous except for adsðÿ˜…,positive
"i don't like the new update, i was using spotify cause it was legal to listening music without using youtube, but since the newest update, i can't choose songs it was random and i need to listen till the end, i could skip but there was a limit to do that. please bring back the old spotify",negative
"this app was a huge hit and improved a lot. but personally, with each update this game makes me wanna cry. what's even 6 skips per hour? i'm not even gonna talk about the ads... this app just turned out to be a big disappointmen. honestly at this point it's even better to pay for youtube music premium",negative
"used to be 5 but now 1 star since recent update. player stops randomly, doesn't show playing, can't start or stop, no controls need to shut the app constantly. fixed by delete and redownload but then a few days later back to the same. utter shite. please give me the old version back.",negative
"ok, the latest update is just horrible, there is a limitation of the number of skips i can do per hour, and i can only play my playlist with shuffle, now my hardwork of making the order of the songs are just ruined, don't download this, plus you need to hear all the other parts of the song just to listen to the chorus, just... don't download this, you're wasting your time, i don't knwo if they will change this tho",negative

huge collection and clear music is appreciated.,positive
ever since the june 2022 update controls no longer work. the only way to pause or stop spotify is to close the app. media controls indicate no media is playing when audio is playing.,negative

i love to listen to music !!!! and so do i love this app,positive
lovely app. user friendly. excellent database. full marks!,positive

"i don't like the update of spotify, when i log in and i gonna play a song it didn't play, the playlist i made is gone and the artists i follow. i wait but didn't work this is so bad.",negative
this app is my most favourite to listen to songs but some songs are hard to find but i still find them i really love it and the opinions to like the video or save it is very helpful especially if i love that song very much and want to listen to it 24/7 thank you creator for making this appðÿ˜„,positive
wonderful music downloader app doesn't have any adds and enjoyable,negative
you have to work on the ui also music suggestions are weak and not showing the new releases.,negative

music list spr sound quality good device connected like it and play music ðÿž¶ good feeling,positive
"this app's updates are increasingly making it worse! the songs are very good even without the premium version, but it makes it so that you will need to purchase it! advertisements after a song ends once in a while is not that bad, but the main issue for me is the playlist customization. i can't rearrange songs, the playlist is always shuffled and sometimes it even plays songs that aren't even in the playlist for no reason! you can't even replay a song and it has a limit on skipping songs!",negative
"too many bugs, also i can't get the spotify widget to stay on after a locked screen. i must unlock the screen, go into the app then change the song, pause etc... not worth the premium family membership fees. i have been a loyal customer for many years, now i think i'll change to another service or way to play music in my car unless it's fixed asap! still no help regarding this issue....",negative
great app for great music. ðÿ’¯,positive
"every week, the app logs me out and i have to delete it and reinstall.",negative

hands down the best music app,positive
brilliant and very enjoyable everyday ðÿ˜€,positive
i enjoyed this app so much but if can be offline it can be more fun and every think is very easy to do i love this app so much,positive
way to many ads so get ready to cough up your clean lung to get ads free. audio quality is not original and stupidly compressed but hey those ads freakin crisp!!!!,negative
easy to navigate way tyriuggt the app,negative
good but it's annoying that you need to listen to entire songs so you can cache them when you are offline. great app though ðÿ‘,negative
"this app is horrible you pick a song and it just make me listen to another song that i barely know probably it's cuz i use the the free kind but still it's horrible ðÿ˜±. it just make me madðÿ˜ ðÿ˜¤ðÿ˜¡. rating:3/10 ps. listen to songs, play podcasts, create playlist and discover music you'll love more like music you hateðÿ˜¡",negative
"great app, van listern to music without wifi!!!!",negative
"this app forces premium. i can live with ads and random shuffle, but now spotify doesn't want to play my playlists i made anymore and spamms premium on me. it's very obnoxious and i can't recommend this app to anyone. i would pay if it was not this forced.. currently a lot of bugs too.",negative
"i've been using spotify for a few years now, we've a family membership. it's great, i rarely find that they don't have a song/tune i'm after. i have my favourites, and every now and then i go through their suggested listening and sometimes find a new favourite. when i visit my dad it's on with spotify and we're filling the house with some oldies, such as bert kaempfert and james last ðÿ˜€",positive
good but if it was free it would have been the best which it is but i would like it if it is free,positive
"so far it has been nice,but i feel spotify can do better by making videos available and also making singles available for individual download",negative
can u remove the shaffle that we can pick songs if we connect to a device or we play on our phones,negative
"previously was good. recent times (a year - last months) various technical problems that continue. audio stops playing randomly. you can also suddenly lose the control buttons of currently playing audio (you lose whole player view; audio controls and info what is playing and progress bar) and have to shutdown and restart the app to hope to get controls back etc. now i noticed problems with skip buttons. everything might work ok for a while, then problems continue.",negative
play bar/controls keep disappearing and i keep having to force stop the app to get it back. tried reinstalling but the problem is still there,negative
best app to listen to your jams & today download. it's so easy to use and premium is worth every penny,positive
i liked the spotify that let me see the songs i had in my playlist.,positive
almost unusable after update. crashes and laggs all the time.,negative
"stuck on splash screen, tried installing and uninstalling but it still doesnt work",negative
please removes the add ðÿ™ ðÿ™ ðÿ˜” except this i am fully satisfy with spotify,positive
stellar music recommendation algorithm one stars less.. for lack of individual song download options also using my smartwatch controls leads to a bug where the currently playing song is wrongly displayed.... edit constantly downloading songs everyone and then,negative
"what i hated here, is that, the premium feature, and random ads, and i cant click my own song, i can't skip, i can't click a song and it said i need to shuffle music ðÿ’€ðÿ˜­ðÿ˜¡ðÿ¤§ðÿ¤§ðÿ¤§",negative
the suggestion song was annoying!!!,negative

pretty good working with google be better if billing could be added to phone bill.,positive
it's ok but i don't get to listen to the music i want or save it without paying every month.,negative
"it keeps playing suggested songs, and i have found no way to turn them off. it irritates me a lot and others are having the same problem as well. other than that, its great",negative
"just switched to spotify from pandora and i have to admit that i like it! the lyrics function is very cool, i wish i could keep them always on instead of reopening lyrics for each song",positive
stuck on loading screen,negative
disappearing media controls (bug known since april 2022) still hasn't been fixed.,negative
"really great music streaming app, but it's unclear what qualifies as explicit in some cases",negative
"spotify was great until it stopped taking my credit card payments for premium like just take my money...pleaseee!!! everytime i type in my credit card info it keeps saying ""payment can't be made. country does not match payment option "". it matched for two months , what's the problem now?",negative
"it's more money than i'd like to spend but the ad free unlimited version is worth it. do wish they would be more understanding with the address verification with family plans as my children travel between my home and my husband as we have been separated. sucks they don't recognize my son on our family plan bc he's only at my address part of the time. i'd also love if the playlist feature was a bit more intuitive to navigate considering i've had some from back in the ""starred"" era",negative
"suddenly i don't have the ""shuffle play"" option on mobile anymore. i can choose a song and then it will shuffle the rest of the que, but i can't just hit play and have it shuffle to a song. i used to be able to and now i can't",negative
pushy and intrusive. auto connects to bluetooth devices with no option to stop it. has soured the user experience.,negative
for some reason lately the app won't show that it's playing and just crash. gets really had to keep track of podcasts and playlists,negative
"very buggy on galaxy s22. after playing something, the play band/navigation doesn't show up and thus can't switch output devices.",negative
"the sound quality is very good and over all the app is amazing,but the ads...ðÿ˜©. the ads are freaking me out,an ad comes after a song.its killing the mood",negative
the like button for added favorite song is not user friendly please add some warring or confirmation to like or dislike a song,negative
downloads always seem to disappear when i need them,negative
paying premium for music that skips. not happy,negative
"i am paying for this app and there is this very basic feature missing. i can't remove my recently played podcast, song from the home page look. why? every app on earth has this feature, why can't spotify? please suggest how to do it. i don't want everyone to see what i listened last if they ever see my phone.",negative
fantastic quality.. amazing music collection!!,positive
i'm glad our favorite songs ate in the library,positive
i love this it help me relieve stress,positive
"my spotify keeps prompting offline even when on data. have done troubleshoot, still same!",negative
spotify is not connecting to the internet ... i already tried all the solutions .. and not working. i do have internet cause other apps are working. even spotify lite is working. its just this version of spotify.,negative
"it's a nice app i enjoy it but it misbehave after using it for some time, it doesn't show playlist you can't select a specific song in the playlists available. i know the is need for upgrade to premium but the limitation you have put in place are not important you can find another way not denying people to select their song of choice. at least downloading for offline is enough limitation for those who are not on premium. anyway it's a good app.",positive
i really like using spotify.,positive
when i play a song not a playlist it plays a different song not evan by the artist,negative
been some problems with playback lately,negative
been using spotify for years now. i really can't fault it ðÿ˜ž,negative
one of the better music streaming platforms; although the free version is steadily losing functionality that is migrated to the fee based subscription service,negative
it's a good app....i can choose a variety of songs for my exercise...just enjoy more music ðÿž¶ love spotify â¤ ðÿ˜ it's addictive...,positive
i love spotify because wherever i go and whatever i do i can listen to my favorite songs,positive
while it's fufills the needs of music when i make a playlist and i delete a added song it doesn't mean i want another one spotify so ya the added songs really doesn't help when i have to pay 10 dollars(which i'll never do) just so i can listen to a song i actually enjoy. without skipping a couple of songs to hope to get the correct song i want to listen too,negative
"ever since the update, all playlists on spotify are telling me there is no music on then. but saying i can start a playlist. it's anoying.",negative
good app for songs,positive
really good app. can at music in the background without premium. not much ads at all. great app. reccomend,positive
spotify asking me to create an account and i already have one and doesn't automatically login now,negative
"i loved spotify before the most recent update because it would let me repeat the songs in my playlists that i like without having to shuffle and shuffling was only optional,also my music used to play without randomly stopping but now it does that often,i still love spotify i just think the app was a bit better than before the most recent update,but this is all in my opinion.on the other hand, i like how you can listen to a piece of the song before you like it or put it in one of your playlists.",positive
very good and very useful. i use it every day.,positive
cannot play any song online. it just freezes and stops songs. it wasn't like this last week so i was wondering what happened. i tried reinstalling but it's still the same.,negative
spotify give me better experience for life!,negative
spotify is not an app thats good to have without premium though if you use the web player it gets better but i like the app very much i don't really have feedback,negative
it's a really good app for listening to music on the go but i dislike when random songs i don't know pop up randomly,negative
downloaded podcasts don't play all the way through without internet. it completely defeats the point of downloading...,negative
not so good. unable to log in even if i m a premium member. also not able to download music. premium services are not available but debiting my account without giving me services every month,negative
"free version of spotify is awful now, instead listening to add to get 30 minutes of music you get two songs and over a minute of ads. also premium keeps going up in price it's a waste of money at this point",negative
i liked it how it was in the beginning all this updating i don't like it messes it up,positive
it is the best song app,positive
i was just trying to logout and it made me leave the app and when i went back on it i couldn't even use it cause it kept me in the logo and this has been happening for 4 days now yall better fix this also fix the fact that we can't hear the sound while in suggest songs,negative
the is very simple and smart to use,positive
"what the hell?? everything was okay untill the new update. this app is impossible to use rn, the songs are playing on shuffle all the time and now they shown like a sentence or something please fix this :(",negative
very authentic in its own way,positive
i love the app don't give me wrong but the app has this problem of playing songs you don't want to listen to. for example i was playing my liked songs and it started to play songs that weren't on my liked songs. (please fix this bug),negative
i love that you can make your own playlists,positive
i love listen music and i love so many different choices!,positive
"downloaded on my phone multiple times, it's not working. it's a black screen with the spotify logo but that's it. will not do anything else. app is up to date, just not working.",negative
spotify is the best music app but adds are dispointed,negative
it's gotten so bad recently the ads are so much now the app also started to just stop playing and needs to force shut down automatically.,negative
best quality of audio but sometimes the ad will come in front of audio,negative
this app used to be great and the only thing i'd use to listen to music but now i can't login or else it crashes my phone and forces it to restart. i can't delete it because it crashes my phone and forces it to restart and so my only option would be to factory reset my phone.,negative
so far so good. it's been amazing working with you all.,positive
"horrible ad placing. like there's literally 5 ads for every song. and they're not short 5 second ads no they're long as 30 second ads. that's a whole song worth of ads for every single song, like i'm not here for ads.",negative
very beautiful journey with spotify,positive
"positive part is your library. anything you search and it is right there. if possible, don't increase the volume sharply while playing ads. it hurts sometimes.",positive
nice except ads,positive
the app is great. i just don't know why the canvas feature doesn't work,negative
"music for free!!! and song's you love,plus it recamend's music of the same johnra,come on",positive
i love spotify. everything is easy to find and tailor fitted for my style of listening,positive
"i love how there are so many songs to play from country to k-pop, plus it has some amazing podcasts. i would rate it a 5 star, but the only thing is, is that you cant change how loud or how low the music or podcast is, ye you could just lower down your phone, but if you have other things, like if you were playing a game, you wouldn't be able to lower the music down so you can hear the game. but overall an amazing app.",positive
"i had a really good experience with spotify but that was only when i had premium. when ur on the free plan u basically can't listen to music in the way you want at all. your playlist/songs are always on shuffle which is weird because sometimes you want your music in a certain order and then u only get 6 skips an hour? so plus shuffle+ only 6 skips is already very strict. to add on you get 4 ads that are all 30 seconds, every 15 minutes. this is pushes people to other apps for a better experience",negative
easy to customised playlist. wide variety of songs,positive
it's good music service the only issue i have is the premium adds i don't mind having regular adds or not having more skips but the constant shoving in your face adds for premium are bad,negative
"new to this , but had a good time listening!",positive
"i want to stop downloading music because i'm not listening to it, but once i turn off the download, it continues to download, which is annoying because what's the point of turning off the download when it's still downloading? you should also include an easy-to-create playlist, such as my favorite songs. i put it on a playlist by category, but my patience isn't long enough to go through hundreds of songs one by one. there are many issues that can be improved. what a waste of money.",negative
i love all the music but i hate podcasts. literally less than zero interest in them but it's always shoving them in my face and often they have awkward pictures that i really don't care to see. the latest is they are in a language i don't even know so that's... cool... would honestly give 5 stars if it weren't for that. i wish i had the option to remove the podcast section or at least dislike them so i don't have to see the awkward pictures.,negative
love this app. easy listening has a lot of music and podcast anything ..its great.,positive
this app is very very good to enjoy music.,positive
can be very frustrating to use at times. ive had a old phone and now a new one. same problems. music rarely shows up what im playing on my home screen and sometimes doesnt show up at all on the spotify app when i clearly just select a song or podcast meaning i cant skip. to fix this you have to do a reinstall or logout login which fixes it for a time before going through the process again. i feel like they have also add a lot more shameless advertisement on podcasts for premium members.,negative
ok i can listen to my favorite songs and i don't need a premium i like the podcast,positive
brings in the best music i need to hear.,positive
new like songs ui is ugly we need back old like songs ui ðÿ˜©,negative
"update:- thank you spotify for resolving below mentioned issue.... ""everything's great but lyrics are not displayed... not resolved till now... my device is mi a3, till date this lyrics issue is not solved...""",negative
i'm loving my experience. great variety of music and podcasts. only downside is needing wifi for music that isn't downloaded.,negative
"the play bar keeps disappearing. only restarting the phone fixes it, but then it disappears again. this problem has been known for 2 months and still not fixed",negative
spotify is easy to use,negative
"this app was ok but it freezes the music while playing games, then when you press play, it restarts the song or skips ... fix pls",negative
can't play downloaded songs when you don't have internet.,negative
music is nice but i'm tired of y'all playing w/ my playlist. y'all are so annoying bro. and the unnecessary updates bro and that ads! u dont need that many ads to gey money bro,negative
best music app that i had used yet,positive
"kept randomly pausing playing music and podcasts. done everything to fix it but to no avail. finally uninstalled and reinstalled the app, but can no longer access the application after that step. it remains stuck on the green logo and doesn't matter how long i wait, it stays there. i have done everything, cleared caches, forced stop, clean reinstallations, checked for updates on app and phone (samsung s10), everything, and nothing works. only this app has stopped working. i am a premium user.",negative
easy to use app. great to listen to the music you like.,positive
"have large amount of song to choose from. however, its hard to just want to listen only to specific track",negative
cannot update my premium. it always try to connect evn tho there is nothing wrong with the network.,positive
it's the best music streaming i've used so far and cheap,positive
if u pay for it it is a great ap to use but if u don't pay for it it will add songs in ur playlist and only give u 6 skips per hour,negative
"love it, so easy to listen to your favourite songs!",positive
"worst possible app. constant bugs and issues, shuffle is a joke, and the weekly recommendations are at least 50% songs i already listen to. premium is losing its worth every day.",negative
less ads would be great but i understand that you can't do that,negative
i've been using this app for over 5 years. it's just recently started to go on another playlist once you've finished the end of your playlist it goes on to another playlist which is really annoying. but other than that issue it's a great app for music if you don't want to pay for itunes and this is why i'm rating this app 4 stars,positive
"i enjoy using the app and have all of my music, podcasts and some audiobooks all in one place. i wish there was a better way to organize files a little more specific then what is available now but i make it work. quality has always been good! the one or two times it messed up after an update i cleared cache, forced stop and the reopened the app. simple enough!",positive
"it's a really good app and i love it! the only minor concern i have is the ads, but that's all! â¤",positive
"grate for tunes, great vibes man ðÿƒðÿ’¨",positive
loving it! took me this long to try it but it was worth the wait,positive
often does not work properly. as a subscriber i demand more,negative
"too many commercials, but i love the set-up. the music is great.",positive
absolutely incredible. keep up the good work.,positive
"very good, one of the best music experience i have had.",positive
"honestly, i like spotify, but i've noticed a new bug: when i don't use spotify, and cancel any music, random music starts playing every 1 or 2 hours. this never happened to me, a few months back. now it's happening constantly",negative
impossible to use liked songs will only play in shuffle controls are unbearable and the app is stuck on one song and will not let me play any others,negative
update has made it keep skipping its ridiculous,negative
"glitches constantly, pauses all the time. def don't pay for a paid membership. what a joke. worst money i've spent this year. fix your app spotify. if i could give you 0 stars i would.",negative
"just another way to be spied on by people with ðÿ’© intentions- i miss the 80s you can laugh, but at least our every move isn't on candid camera, all our likes & dislikes are monitored. technology is a donkey. wait, that's mean to donkeys... you get the point- enjoy your shower! may as well do it on the front lawn!!!! ðÿ¤ª",negative
it's alright i do have issues when looking for music some you don't have when i try look for them,positive
i want to cancel my membership but there is no where in the app to do so,negative
"it has been an upgrade from our last service provider, pan something ?",negative
"to the person or team worked on the search, nicely done! i normally only notice things when they don't work well or break, but the spotify search is smart enough to match lyrics too, as well as correct common mistakes",positive
spotify playlist is perfect,positive
where did the play now bar go?!?! also i can't flag offensive ads and dislike them. suggested songs for playlist should be an option. otherwise good app. thanks,positive
had premium for 7 years. found my favorite music and the style that makes my life better.,positive
stop hijacking my lock screen with album art! i don't want everyone to know that i'm listening to the frozen soundtrack ðÿ˜‚,negative
great app listen to it all day everyday,positive
very good choice of music. easy to understand and use. plenty of playlists to choose from.,positive
more problems than any other streaming service. even deezer is more reliable.,negative
"your app needs a major redesign.the joe rogan podcast deal didn't make podcasts better on your app. try a redesign of the ui that makes sense. that makes it easier to discover new things.make it a more social and connected network. some new button deisgns, colour schemes, symmetry, minimalist.dark and light mode. i can go on forever.pump that cash into a user friendly design and make it available both for ios and android at the same time.give users control.windows xp media player visualisation.",negative
when i play a podcast most of the time now it doesn't have the page to set a timer or fast forward the podcast etc. considering i'm paying premium i expect better,negative
i hate this app like there is a couple times when the wi-fi is strong but then it's still having problems working like it has its times when it doesn't work the way it's supposed to meaning the music won't work or the music will glitch which is why i hate this app other than that it's a pretty bad app it even shows lyrics which is good if you want to learn the lyrics of the song. i really hate the ads especially after like 5 minutes it goes to having three ads and everytime please fix that.,negative
"i hate ads, but im poor, so what can i do, right?",negative
brings back many memories with the songs i chose.,positive
i love this app but the only thing i don't like about it is that it repeats a lot of songs.,negative
it's the greatest thing since jelly with peanut butter.,positive
"perfect except that not playing what i want thing. its just annoying. (frankly reminding that tyler, the creator is best)",positive
its good but the ads are annoying,negative
its good am movieng alongside hopefully to enjoy,positive
"was amazed with the customizing and shared info how awesome the choice of music was, as sometimes it can be humiliating, it's more relevant. i believe in this, and music helps me more then words can explain. this is one app i love and recommend.",positive
75% of the content you'll be listening to here is back-to-back ads. i hope there's a way to delete my account somehow....,negative
great and wonderful to find any kind of music i love,positive
i have a busted speaker and it is still clear and i hear the still clear,positive
"spotify is an app that i'm always using but since the new update, the app just don't want to open it freeze. i tried everything ðÿ˜ª, i don't know what to do.",negative
it plays songs that i don't want!!! it doesn't even deserve a star!! fix it!!,negative
wont let me skip or turn off shuffle spotify isnt bad but spotify mobile is horrible.,negative
"i love spotify but on my new android (motorola 5g stylus) it randomly crashes the app during a song and when i open it back up the song is there but restarted, its really annoying and needs to be fixed",negative

"fantastic app. had it for years, only sucks when your broke for a bit you lose playlist but they do keep it until your back on top. great quality sound.",positive

it sometimes goes back to a songs it already played and i have to listen to them again.,positive
the app is too slow. but overall it's a great app to play music,positive

much better now but still lacking in a few ways. i still really want the option to fine tune what kind of tracks play in a radio and to have a supermix for when i want to listen to a little bit of everything and not sure what exactly to listen too.... edit: now just crashes on my a53 kinda disappointed,negative
"i love spotify, especially when i have premium",positive
love that i can find any song... going down memory lane!,positive
"i got spotify premium a few months ago. at the beginning, everything was fine. a few crashes here and there. now not even the currently played song is correct - like: how. moreover buttons partially need minutes to react. spotify tells me over and over again i got no connection, though everything else internet related works just fine. the sd card implementation just works for a part. the app is laggy, crashes and basic functions stop working over time. please start working on performance & fixes",negative
after last these last few updates it's become incredibly glitchy,negative
can be better. algorithms can be improved.,negative
over adds while during using the app,negative

so easy so navigate.,positive
this is a great app but at times it just refuses to launch. has been like this on and off for a couple months now. slightly frustrating.,negative
"highly unresponsive after you open spotify from overview press at bottom screen. you have to either shut it down and launch it again or wait for it to load for almost 15 seconds, then the app wakes up and starts running. very annoying and have to press almost 5 or 6 times to play a song.",negative
love the ease of use and the huge choice of albums. use it on wi-fi for tunes on our harley and our patio. uses very little battery.,positive
"a great app for music streaming, has a great free feature allowing basic music streaming, then the premium version is awesome allowing ad free and higher quality music streaming; while also being able to go offline.",positive
can't just download 1 song from album when rest of album is rubbish amazon you can and so much simpler to use,negative
if i don't have premium and i try to listen to the songs on my playlist it playing songs that are not on the playlist. i would suggest that you fix that so that we can just listen to the songs on our playlist than listening to something that is not on the playlist,negative
"decent but......this app has potential to be great but the podcasts stop on every single podcast out of the blue, i have to keep manually hitting play which is not feasible to working in a clean room and not being able to touch your device. please fix. also, it'll play podcasts i've previously listened to and deleted randomly. annoying!!!!",negative
greatest music service ever.,positive
playback always stopped suddenly,negative

impossible to listen to offline playlists unless started on wifi.,negative
"i enjoy my spotify premium, it lets me play musics i want and gives me a time of my life. but when using another app or playing some as background music, the player keeps crashing everytime it plays only 1 song. its annoying how i need to go back to spotify and play it again. but it repeats the crashing too, please fix this. my money is worth nothing if this doesn't even get fixed.",negative
"i've only just started using spotify, but i enjoy it. it plays the music i enjoy and, so far, no repeats.",positive
"has gotten better over time, but certain bugs like shared playlists not showing up in the list have been present for ages.",negative
won't play anything that i select. it just gives me a black screen. a little mad since i just paid for premium.,negative
this music app is really good ðÿ˜†,positive
i love the update but.... my pc account dont have premium stuff but i have it purchased just fix it please. but that it have good song up to 10 million songs.,positive
"the worst, most unstable app i've ever used for android. audio goes out when screen turns off, audio controls frequently crash while playing, integrated ads crash podcasts, audio skips, etc. i want to support spotify because of commitment to free speech, but such an awful, unstable pos makes it a challenge.",negative
this service is great but the app crashes and causes the app i am using to crash.,negative
"don't know why i'm paying for subscription, none of my downloads are available, it'll say downloaded, show how many i have, but nothing is available to play while i am out of cell and wifi range. everything works when i have connection, but i download shows and music so i can play when out of service, which is like more than half of my life working in remote alaska. downloaded items should be available without a connection. now after update, even with connection, i can't play anything",negative
i like the app because it takes lesser time to find songs,positive
"i love spotify, but when i need to update it, my whole computer breaks (my computer isn't old at all, in fact it is only 6 months old) it can be extremely laggy, but i love it nonethless ( i just wish it didn't lag so bad and break my computer)",negative
lovely and the best app ever yo hear music. thx for creating this app ðÿ‘,positive
ok i've resorted to begging because it's literally impossible to make playlists without being able to hear a sample of the song in the add section. please. just add that back and i will give 5 stars thats all i want. why would you take that away. the only reason i dont switch music apps is because of how many playlists i already have at this point. bleh. the bare minimum has been restored.,negative
"great app, it's just when i click on a song it usually plays a random song.",positive
have used this app since launch and love it!,positive
easy to work,positive

"too many ads, i understand that if i don't have premium i will need to see ads but there are too many! i already learned the disney plus ad and i had no intention in learning it!",negative
after every update it becomes worst because ads increase almost after 2 song ads start. and it irritated everyone ðÿ˜žðÿ˜žðÿ˜žðÿ˜žðÿ˜ž . now i feel that downloaded song in your device is better to use this..... ðÿ˜”ðÿ˜”ðÿ˜”ðÿ˜”,negative
"i hope you add data saver where the lyrics and background videos dont play, for data users sake. and also i hope you give random related songs suggestions when we play so we can explore more like in yt music app",negative

i think that spotify is good but it doesn't have so many songs that i like but is still good,positive
too many ads in it,negative

"your app sucks... the autoplay doesnt work, i get to hear more ads than music... and i don't understand that why does the autoplay have so much issue... update: the auto play still sucks... update 2.: now the app refuses to start... update 3: player has become buggy... update 4: repeating songs in discovery queue... update 5: your app player is dead...",negative
"i have been using this app for over a year but, recently the app has gone down hill. the ability to preview songs before adding them to playlists was removed making it 10 times harder to form a good playlist. then there is the issue with the ""30 minutes of uninterrupted listening."" it has never and probably will never be 30 minutes which just makes it unbearable to listen to. nvm its back now ads still suck though",negative
"this is the best app for alone vibing but the one thing is we can't download songs, we should have a premium account",negative
excellent app but please get rid of the ads.,negative

first you could choose songs from between your playlist and put your favourite songs but now you have to wait for you to listen to that song it's not how it used to be alot more things i would like to tell you but i won't i'll let the rating decide my experience,negative
"i used to love this app. but after the update i'm hating this. the song which i want to listen, which i play it gives u another song. it's really annoying. i can't listen the songs which i want to listen. if you can't listen to your favourite songs, then what's the point to use spotify? it says you can only skip the song if you buy the premium one. dude i donâ€™t want to buy the premium one. before updating this app it was too good but what happend after the update. itâ€™s really annoying",negative
unable to dismiss the advertisements .. fix it,positive

"it has been great since i purchased premium but some of my songs don't get downloads i don't know what is wrong, can't see lyrics when offline and some of the songs are know where to be found like park jimin's promise and others. before premium was hell like it has more ads than any other apps i've ever encountered, at one point i thought i might break my phone when ads came out of nowhere but everything is good now i guess except for those things i mentioned right above.",positive
i hate this app because you literally have to wait an hour just to skip a song,negative
excellent app. keep improving with new features,positive
it's free music and all but there need to be a membership for ads if you are looking into it so do download and enjoy,negative

i like the no interruptions,positive
good app for nice song,positive
best ever music app ever seen this kinda of app. it's so rocking. but the ad disturbs you seriously..,positive
we don't all have bank accounts for premium. not our fault. at least create a physical account so we can deposit cash with reference to our email or otp or something..,negative
even when i have premium i don't get premium features,negative
continue to have problems with app not stopping play. app will say nothing is playing but there it is definitely playing. i have to go into settings and force stop the app. also will do the opposite. i will open the app and can't get anything to play and will have to force stop the app. then it seams to work for awhile.,negative
i paid for premium and am getting commercials. what a scam!,negative
every thing is okay but only if you could make it usable without much data.,negative

when i logged out it never opened again. i reinstalled and restarted my phone. it's still stuck at the spotify logo screen.,negative
"while i think that spotify deserves way more stars, i do habe some problems with the app in general. for example, while in offline mode, the app will repeatedly reset all downloaded songs, so that it simply doesn't work. the playlist i've downloaded shows the little icon at the top that it's all downloaded, but when i scroll down, the songs just don't play and neither do they have the little download icon. it's just really annoying me because then i have to redownload the songs and use data",negative
amazing if it was totally free,positive
good functions well designed,positive
"when i am listening to music it keeps on randomly pausing the music for a split second the carries on playing it, or i have to turn on my phone to stop it from doing that. i have the latest update and it still does it. i think it is still experiencing glitches.",negative

laggy and doesn't open,negative
"it was fine until that auto shuffle happened, if i try to play from my liked playlist, it plays songs that i never heard before. it won't let me play other songs without it being in playlist shuffle either. it would be fine if that wasn't added, let people enjoy listening to the music they like and not have to pay for premium to stop that auto shuffle.",negative
pauses for no reason and podcasts just refuse too play at all,negative
the best music streaming site there is!,positive
"wonderful music to listen to, anytime",positive
"ads are frustrating but spotify always makes it easy to get a trial or extend user membership. the most user-friendly app for music and podcasts, in my opinion.",positive
"i have used my spotify on numerous devices over the years. that being said, spotify has always been a challenge to play music and podcasts in areas with less than great cell service. web pages and youtube videos will load but spotify will not. very frustrating when i pay for this subscription. saved music and podcasts take extremely long to register when offline and will often tell me ""no connection "" overall i love the content so i will keep paying",negative
"nice app,though can you stop shuffling my songs with other songs that i dont want to listen to?",positive
best live music streaming app i've ever utilized. i couldn't find any shortfalls not to rate it 5*****!,positive

"i loved this app but recently when updated i cannot play songs from the playlistd that i made and when i press the play button it says that i get only 6 skips per hour. i mean like ""what the hell"". i want to play the songs in an order i have set my self. not mixed. and whenever i play a song spotify premium keeps coming off. i'm deleting this song until this is fixed. until then bye.",negative
lots of playing options... both old and new school music...top notch,positive
i love listening to music so this a a great app for music. i can listen to music anywhere any time.,positive
only advertisement for our premium,negative
worse app ever..!! if we search good song for caller tune. it's not available. they can't search know songs also sometimes jio team makes everything for business. at first everything was free not they are charging for everything,negative
why i can't play the song? i have paid for premium,negative
"hi, i've been using spotify from 3 months it was a amazing experience but it does not open now it's saying i'm ofline but i have unlimited wifi access i have been trying to open it by deleting it and then installing it but it doesn't work please sort out the problem...",negative
it is the better but a am chose one star because this app ads so iriteded,negative

good but some songs missing in list,negative
i bet it would be better if you can add gif photo to your playlist,negative
"use every day on a paid for choice, so no ads. just add to my play lists as and when. no drop outs & used the downloads option while on holiday so didn't have to worry about wi-fi or data use.",negative
"its a great music app, i really love it but my suggestion is, could you make an update where we could download 1 song and not the entire album, because if we have to download all the song in the album, its really consuming our storage on our phones.",negative
changed my review because the app didn't work for me. i accidentally logged out from my acc but when i tried to login again the app just blank(black). nothing. i've restarted my phone and reinstall the app but still the same thing happened.,negative
that is a good music app,positive
it used to be a great app but now it just became bad. you have to watch atleast 5 videos after a song and you only get 6 skips an hour (a ridiculously low amount). when you find the song you want it ridiculously plays a different song by another singer instead the song you want. i'm not sure how you guys get payed to do this but you need to fix it now.,negative
"it's awesome ,but too much ads interupt",negative
"what happened to spotify it's not the same, whenever i choose a single or album the songs are not there and when i it different music will play",negative
dears kindly i have a problem with the app after i updated my phone as the app does not open,negative
keep it that way. ads free,positive
mc why too many ads always.,negative
please make us play any song without using premium,positive
podcast is good & clear,positive
excellent great music app ðÿ‘.,positive
so enjoyable and relaxing ðÿ˜žðÿ˜žðÿ˜ž,positive

"i don't what happened but all of the sudden it stop working so, i tried to restart the app but it now just show a blank screen i tried about 15 installing and uninstalling it but still won't work",negative
it's great. all the music i could ever wish for.,positive
"great, but i was hoping to be able to change podcasts while driving, but that seems dangerous.",negative
"it's a great app, i just wish the playlists were not shuffled by songs that are not in the playlist",positive
it so good 10/10 the best place to lease to music,positive
"frequent crashes, also i pay for the premium and still get advertising for the jre!? still better then pandora but maybe not worth buying.",negative
"""offline mode"" is the biggest useless feature ever. i might actually cancel my spotify acct over the amount of times i've tried to listen to my downloaded music while away from data service and cant. how useless.",negative
my experience with spotify is great. i love this platform. thanks spotify team.,positive
was a good app. until you couldn't play the song without shuffling. and the layout is different. i advise you to go back to youtube music. at least could play a song. :(,positive
"great, love the choices and suggestions",positive
fantastic range of easily accessed music,positive
i've been using spotify for years and overall it's okay i just don't like that after every 2 or 3 songs there's an add.,negative

this is best listing app i ever seen,positive
i wish i didn't have to use data whenever i wanted to listen to all my songs at once,negative
"i can't live without spotify,i love it",positive
the app is so useful. you can listen to the songs while doing anything n everything. songs makes emotions more valuable. but i think they should decrease the rate of ads a little bit that's why i am giving it 4 for now but it will be set to 5 when the ad rate is deacresed. the song quality is so good that's why i will recommend to use this app for sure.,negative
you have to buy there stupid premium just to play a single song i literally have to go through 20 songs just to get to the one i want,negative
"iâ€™ve been a spotify user for a long time, but just this year iâ€™m having some discomfort using spotify. my internet network is very good, but itâ€™s hard to play music",negative
too many ads,negative
really good on xbox i can listen to music as i play games.,positive
"everything is way good, but make a comment section for every song, so that people can write their thoughts on their favourite songs. in this way the music artists will also come to know, how listeners feel about their creations. -thankyou :)",positive
group sessions don't work at l all,negative
"hey! spotify team please help i am trying to login to my spotify account for past week with this same email id and i have made many attempts but my account is not opening ðÿ¥ºðÿ¥º.. i also have a student plan and most importantly my life without music is so empty, my day starts with listening to music and also ends with music.. please resolve my issue asap..please ðÿ¥º",negative
very nice music app. other junk apps have ads that interrupt my sleep process. this just works.,positive
too slow and can't choose music to play,negative
best dang app for music ever,positive
this is free music with hardly any time having ads but when you do get ads there are at least 2 ads that aren't skippable but its worth it five out of five spotify if you see this review i just want to say thank you for it not having to be paid for,positive
my playlist keeps being shortened somehow and everytime i play a song from my playlist and close my playlist music stops and i can't play it it was fine yesterday but today its rlly bothering me..sorry but can u fix what's going on?,negative
"hi, can you fix it when i play my favorite song it always short song",negative
"terrible. not worth it. used to be great but now i can't get through one song or podcast anymore without it buffering or skipping. even downloaded songs have issues. i tried everything- resetting my wifi, removing all downloaded songs, clearing the cache, lowering streaming quality, uninstalling then reinstalling. don't waste your time with this one",negative
spotify is not working in my phone,negative
"i think spotify is great but its 5 times better with premium though and i think $10 a month is not that bad. it has absolutely all songs created. overall i think spotify is the best app for music, podcasts, and stories. such qaudale dingle.",positive
its playlists are awesome,positive
great nothing found wrong but how can u download songs from therer,negative
"not opening on my mobile.. just showing a blank page with logo and then gets stuck.. i cleared my cache, updated to the latest version, rebooted my device, still the problem continues!",negative
music quality not so good,negative
"it bothers me that when you don't have a premium when the ads come on they sound 10 times louder than the music sounds, which is a problem when you listen to music with a speaker or with headphones, because it forces you to turn up the volume because you don't listen to the song and then feel like you're going deaf from the commercials",negative
great music of the 70s and 80s,positive
i cant seem to get a way to download a song and listen offline. but the app is so far so best,positive
one of my favorite apps of all time. been using them for about 9 years now and they keep getting better !! i'm up to 30 hours of amazing tunes on my markus aurelius pl 1. check it out and subscribe. you're gonna love it i'm sure ðÿ˜€ðÿž¸ðÿž¶ðÿžµðÿž¶ðÿžµðÿž¶âœœï¸,positive

"one night i just turned on spotify, when it said my free trial was up... the one i diden't even ask for. i was ok with it untill i saw my playlist. the only option was ""shuffle"" i couldn't even listen to the songs in order! i tried to, and whenever i clicked on the names of the songs listed out, and would only let me hear a clip. i need music to go to sleep. the ads where loud even though i had my volume down. still anoyed, the layout is way to complicated if you don't have primium.",negative
"first time not opening the app, bad app",positive
"sad because of blatant censorship. my podcast episodes with the covid ""warning"" on them, crash the program. so effectively i cannot listen to any podcasts that do not fit the narrative.",negative
sound quality in premium category has decreased. earlier i was really impressed compare to any other music streaming app.,negative
i can't play my playlist:/,negative
"totally love this app, i don't any trouble looking for muaic on my current mood because the app already has category that you can choose from with any current state of mind you have.",positive

too many ads,negative
"it's a great app but there are so many adds inbettwen the songs, albeit they only pop up after about 3-7 song or if you restart a song. but i've had i up to 8 ads in a row before my next song began to play, and the ads could range from 15 to 30 seconds. but the audio is great and all the options in the settings are enjoyable. so, the main thing is want changed is the huge amount of ads, after all they take up more time then most of the songs themselves! it's just overkill at this point.",positive
would be 5 stars but when i'm playing music when i've listened to every song it plays random songs,negative
"great app, free version might have ad breaks but still great, thanks spotify ðÿ‘ðÿ‘ðÿ‘ðÿ‘ðÿ‘",positive

best music and it has all the music u like,positive
"terrible, you can't even pick an exact song without paying $10 a month, just get youtube vanced, it has way better selection, you have the freedom to pick the actual song you want to listen to and there's no ads.",negative
"i use spotify on a phone and ,oh boy, it's a nightmare. first of all there's a ridiculous amount of adds,you only get six times to skip a song and it resets in an hour, and you can't pick what song you listen to, there's only shuffle.",negative
stop adding songs to the playlist i create if i wanted to listen to that music i would have played a list that would have me discover songs! i created my own playlist so i don't have to use my skips looking for a song i want. very disappointing the app would be great if this was fixed. don't wast your time getting frustrated.please fix this,negative

my overall experience was amazing! i've discovered new songs that i didn't know l would like! so thank you for making this app. <3,positive
"the app is not bad overall, just the fact that it takes a few days for lyrics to be uploaded after a song has been released. also not all songs have lyrics. bhorex",positive
they gave me 6months free trial and so far love it,positive
the media player outside of the app and the progress bar inside the app disappear way to frequently. i have to hard quit the app multiple times to resolve the issue.,negative
"annoyed by how many unstable ads there are and decided to review about it specifically. i get around 10+ ads in a row and only 2-3 songs. maybe 5 ads in a row at least. this is normal when i play music, and it shouldn't be. rare for my playlists to have no ads for 30 minutes as spotify states. it used to not be this messy. please code whatever to fix this, it's an everyday situation. i shouldn't jump from each playlist to try and find the right spot to get ""30 min free listening.""",negative
add a damn option to confirm whether you want to connect to a certain bluetooth device or not. had too many occasions where the options for connections would bounce all over the place due to constantly finding and forgetting ones only to mis-click away from the thing i wanted instead to a device someone else is always using. awkward to use and inconvenient.,negative
it just stopped working,negative
after two or three song they give a long add which is really anonning .when i use the first there will have add but add remain after the 30 min,negative
"this app is good. but for some reason, the shuffle is always on... but when the pc version comes into use, it's always off. is the songs policy always behind a paywall or you guys just want to get money by premium... this isn't why ""free"" streaming apps are for... the shuffle isn't helping you by you're problems.... it's just making the listener's mood and their problems unsolvable...",negative
i've had the same spotify premium for 6 years and let me tell you. wayyyyyy better than apple music or amazon whatever it's called. 10/10 recommend. keep up the good work spotify. i love you â£ï¸,positive
the only problem is when you dont have premium it gives you like 6 ads at a time,negative
"great , affordable music app!",positive
"podcasts turn off by themselves, sound plays without app controls",negative
"was a good app but then all my playlists started coming up with: we added... which is really annoying, because u can't get rid of them. it also only let me play 5 secs of what i wanted 2 play, so after the last update it is bad",negative

i absolutely love this app. the free version is amazing and premium is even better. i get to listen on the way to work and simply whenever i want. there's music for everyone. as a lesson whose tastes varie from day to day and are simply all over the place i'm very satisfied. they also have people who are willing to help if there are any issues. 10 our of 10 in my opinion.,positive
too many ads. it's annoying.,negative
"its the best especially, if you have premium.",positive
i love every aspect of this app!,positive
"great at finding songs, and making recommendations.",positive
"there's no order to shuffling, you'll be listening to an up-beat song and suddenly an extremely depressing song comes on, it really ruins the mood. i'm sure if they can organize their playlists into upbeat and sad songs, they can organize their shuffling.",negative
"this app has lots of podcasts and i love those , you can also try these podcasts of crime & thriller.",positive
"hi this app i great but it keeps adding songs i don't want on my playlist and it's really annoying because i don't like them. please fix this, thankyou",negative

lately the app has this pause thing going on whilst listening to some music. once thought it's my headphones but it was not,negative
"if i could rate this a 0 i would, my name is hannah and i'm 11 and i absolutely hate this app. i downloaded it and signed in made a playlist and what happend you may ask, well they added what they wanted onto it, it's so rude and when i tried to delete it of it said that i couldn't because they had picked it special for me, and it wouldn't let me play any other songs in my playlist, so just like that an hour after i down loaded it it's been installed an hour later. i'm never downloading again",negative
its perfect music to use for study or for fun some to use to dance to and sing to it is perfect,positive
very good app for any other music ðÿž¶ you can find what ever you like to look up.,positive

"great, easy to use. the cross fade between songs is a nice feature",positive
"the app is amazing! i really love the interface, its easy to use, and collation of suggested playlist is awesome",positive
my spotify apps was force stop,negative

"app doesn't perform well, but i like the layout and the features",positive
"i love the app, but it would be really fun if there was a drag and drop functionality between playlists in the desktop app. i know that's hard or maybe not possible to implement, just a thought.",negative
wont let me play my songs and keeps playing other songs.,positive
everything is v.well but when i search a song then single song isn't shown as search result then i played album then it's auto set on loop then the song isn't played another artist song played i don't know why but please change this feature or guide user.,negative
really good app to listen to music with! downside is that you need mobile data to listen to music when you don't have wi-fi and to get no wi-fi/mobile data needed to listen to it you need to pay and some people are broke as *cough cough* me *cough cough* ðÿ˜­ðÿ˜­,negative
is just a great music app in general,positive

sad to say that since the latest samsung phone update spotify will not work. it appears to be connected showing green moving bars on the tune selected but is mute. also the app appears frozen as it is not possible to start or pause.,negative
the first app which is bestest for listening musics,positive
excellent job with lyrics. love this app â¤ï¸,positive
a have a lot of problems with it but the most important is the fact that i can't search up a song and play it on its own without listening the that specific whole album. and if you try selecting the album to pick out and play that specific song it won't work it just plays what it want from that album. and also freezes my attempt to skip the songs till i get to the one i want after 6 tries for one whole hour. i was actually trying to rate it 0 but i see 1 is the lowest,negative
"works in my smart tv, plays good song, everything available. i always buy the premium subscription and i highly recommend it.",positive
"my spotify started freezing and won't open. when i try to log in it pretends to log in and then shows the login screen again and doesn't log back in. it started happening like this last night, i logged out of my account and it stayed that way. i deleted the app, restored or restarted but still the same, please help.",negative
i've been paying more for less. every time i open the app i'm spammed with an ad about some new content from someone i've never shown interest in. now i'm getting ads for their car thing.,negative
love to stream podcasts and wide variety of music.,positive
it's cool i hate how persistent the ads can be sometimes but yeaa,positive
"same old glitchy bs from the beginning. this service isn't worth the money. won't play app closes itself. stop playing randomly, start playing randomly. so all and all not worth it",negative
i do love this app. i use it daily.,positive
"what the hell happened?? i used to love using spotify but now it keeps pausing randomly in the middle of my songs and podcasts. and there's some kind of weird glitch where when you press play, it'll start playing the song. but you can't pause it, skip to the next song, or even see what song is playing. i don't know what happened but this app is barely usable at this point.",negative
easy to use and fast,positive
i get my fix whenever i need it. im addicted! it's a great addiction. please don't leave me. sounds like a red flag i know. thanks spotify. ðÿ˜ƒ,positive
